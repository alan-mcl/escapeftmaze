Escape From The Maze
============

A party-based, first-person, fantasy CRPG with phased combat, class-based character progression, 
and programmer-art. I called it "old school" until the term got trendy. It started inspired by 
Wizardry VII and the lack of a free open source alternative. Today we are living in the indie 
revolution and there are far more influences, but the game still clearly shows its Wizardry lineage. 
It's playable end to end, but there is a lot more to do before it's done. This repo hosts the source.
