Escape From The Maze
---------------------------------------
This platform independent distro of Escape From The Maze requires Java 6 or
later installed in your environment.

To run the game, execute the 'run.sh' script. To start the editor, execute
the 'editor.sh' script. Either of these apps may need to be edited depending
on how Java is installed in your environment.

For game documentation, please refer to:

If you encounter a bug, please either log it in the Tracker system at
SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/escapeftmaze) or simply mail it
to me (alan.mcl@gmail.com). The first thing you'll be asked for is log data
(from directory /log/<timestamp>/), and the second thing is a save game that
reproduces the bug (from directory /data/default/save/).
