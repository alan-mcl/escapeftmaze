== Garret
The Grey Wayfarer, He Who Wanderers In Shadows

The ambivalent patron of heroes, adventurers and wayfarers; the cloaked one who stands guard before those who watch their own backs.

He Who Sows And He Who Reaps, The Eyeless Face

The deathly god of the underworld - a god of emptiness and endings. A desert god, a god of unlife, a god of fire and ice.

The jackal, the vulture and the scorpion are his creatures, and his holy places are in the wastelands, deserted tombs and charred ruins.

== Wasud
The Knight of Swords, the Warbrinder, Defender Of The Broken Wall

Patron of gladiators and mercenaries, strife and combat. Sometimes he rides to battle on a mighty bull, and the falcons are his eyes and ears.
