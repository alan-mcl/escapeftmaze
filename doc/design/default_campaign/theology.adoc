Various deities are referenced, mostly as flavour.

== Garret
The Grey Wayfarer, He Who Wanderers In Shadows

The ambivalent patron of heroes, adventurers and wayfarers; the cloaked one who stands guard before those who watch their own backs.

== The White Lady
Isolde, The Shield Maiden, Iron Goddess of Justice and Mercy.

Bearing the spear of Truth in one hand and the shield of Faith in the other, she watches over the just and the downtrodden; patron of soldiers, pilgrims and peasants.

== Nergal
He Who Sows And He Who Reaps, The Eyeless Face

The deathly god of the underworld - a god of emptiness and endings. A desert god, a god of unlife, a god of fire and ice.

The jackal, the vulture and the scorpion are his creatures, and his holy places are in the wastelands, deserted tombs and charred ruins.

== Wasud
The Knight of Swords, the Warbrinder, Defender Of The Broken Wall

Patron of gladiators and mercenaries, strife and combat. Sometimes he rides to battle on a mighty bull, and the falcons are his eyes and ears.

His followers find their holy places on battlefields and on the walls of their strongholds.

== Aello
The Runner, She Who Flies

The messenger goddess, she of the wing and the whirlwind, faster than a ray of sunshine. She carries word on swiftly and surely. The gull, the deer and the lion follow in her footsteps.

Mistress Of The Rains, Lady Of The Harvest

The spring goddesses, patrons of sunshine, fertility, rain and love. They of the shining face bring growth and health on all creatures.

Her holy places are fertile valleys and spring-fed groves, and the swallow and rabbit are found there.

== Thyra
The Weaver, Mistress of Fate, Eldest Of The Seven

The goddess who spins the threads of destiny, weaving together the fates of all beings. She is both revered and feared, as her decisions are final and cannot be undone.

Her creatures are the moth and the owl, and her holy places are crossroads and spinning wheels.

The Stone Hand, The Judge

A stern and implacable god of law, order, and retribution. Kalrath ensures that justice is meted out, regardless of mercy.

He is worshiped by judges, lawgivers, and executioners. His sacred places are courtrooms and gallows, and his symbols are the gavel and the iron chain.

== Lunara
The Queen Of Moons, Mistress of Dreams

The goddess of the moon, dreams, and illusions. Lunara rules over the night, guiding travelers and those who wander in the realm of sleep.

Her symbols are the crescent moon and the veil, and her creatures are the owl and the wolf.

== Vireen
The Crimson Veil, Lady of Lies

A mysterious goddess who governs over secrets, lies, and hidden knowledge.

Vireen is invoked by spies, assassins, and those who seek the unknown. Her sacred places are dark alleys and hidden libraries, and her symbols are the mask and the key.
