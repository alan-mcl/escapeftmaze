= The Wild Hunt

The party opens a secret Gate to part of the realms of Faerie. Gold magic suffuses the enchanted forest, strange flowers and fungi grow in the eerie glades.

Through the fantastic forest, the fey Wild Hunt rides. Sidhe lords in glowing glass armour ride tall horses through the forest pathways. Woe to any mortals caught in the path of the hunt.
