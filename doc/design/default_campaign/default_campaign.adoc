= Episode 1: The Second Realm

== Intro
No one remembers any more how the various races came to be imprisoned in the Maze. For uncounted generations the Maze has been their jail and their jailer, and few have ever escaped its clutches.

The Maze is formed of many domains, some as large as continents, others as small as houses. Domains are joined by lesser gates, various in appearance but uniform in their function of transporting a traveller across time and space. Domains that are interconnected by easily passable gates make up a Realm; Realms are joined by greater Gates, always perilously guarded, and form the outward path a traveller seeking to escape the Maze must follow...

The First Realm is, perhaps, the most subtle and dangerous trap that the Maze has in it's arsenal. Offering several large, safe domains, it is a gilded cage that few banished there care to escape. Here the races of the Realm have established their peaceful and prosperous settlements, where most are content to remain rather than brave the terrors of the Maze.

YOU are different. Not for you the passive acceptance of captivity, silence in the face of this ancient injustice - an injustice that no one even bothers to speak of any more. Whispered rumours told you of those before you that had left the First Realm to try their hand at escaping the Maze. None have ever returned.

And so you gathered what equipment and like-minded comrades that you could and left your home behind, setting out into the wild areas in the centre of the First Realm where none dared tread. The journey was long and hard, beset by hazards and foes you could barely have imagined before you left, but you prevailed and at long last came to the chamber of the Gate atop a unnamed windswept mountain, and defeated in battle the guardian beast left there to watch over it.

Without hesitation, you step through the first Great Gate and forever leave the First Realm behind...

== Default Campaign Storyboard

The default campaign begins as the party, having just escaped from the First Realm, steps through the great gate and enters the Second.

The theme of the default campaign is of the party leaving comfort zones, going against the grain, of not accepting the status quo, of taking risks and venturing into uncertainty to achieve greatness. It is the story of voluntarily leaving safety and ease and journeying into the vast unknown where the danger is great and the chance of success and value of the rewards is uncertain. The ultimate lesson is that change is the only constant, that strife leads to growth and that limitations need not be unthinkingly accepted.
