= The First Realm

The First Realm is, perhaps, the most subtle and dangerous trap that the Maze has in it's arsenal. Offering several large, safe Domains, it is a gilded cage that few banished there care to escape. Here the races of the Realm have established their peaceful and prosperous settlements, where most are content to remain rather than brave the terrors of the Maze.

The First Realm consists of two rings of Domains. On the outside are six large temperate Domains. These surround three less hospitable domains - predominantly mountainous. In the center is a large, wild Domain that contains the Great Gate to the Second Realm.

Of the outer Domains:

* Cosmopolitan human cities with thriving trade dot most of the large outer Domains.
* Immortal elves bide their time in white castles in the forests.
* The warm coastlines and island chains of several Domains are dotted with Merfolk villages.
* Troll hamlets are scattered in the hills of many Domains here, as well as some of the inner Domains.
* Atop an isolated plateau, a domed and spired city of Naga has been transported from outside the Maze.
* A small colony of Automata inhabit a shanty town and slowly dwindle as their resources run out.


Of the inner Domains:

* Dwarves keep a large city delved deep into the mountains.
* Mirka tribes roam above ground and dwell in villages shallow cave complexes.
* A colony of Salamanders has inhabited a dormant volcano.


In the center of the Realm, dire foes lurk in a wild, uninhabited Domain. Dark forests and swamps surround a central mountain range of young, jagged peaks. In a cave beneath the highest peak, a guardian beast defends the chamber of the Great Gate, the only way to proceed to the Second Realm.

== Places

Bleak Hills: In winter the Bleak Hills are frosted still and the wilder Mirka tribes cross the Gates from the snow-bound mountains to hunt in the pale sunlight. In summer the rains come falling sideways in the east wind and turn the hills into a labyrinth of flash floods and mud slides. Inhabited by few villages and crofters.
