default.temple.of.the.gate.end=As I always expected, our valour has won us through! We have won out against all that the Maze could throw at us.
default.tornado.mountain.dragon.cave=
default.writhing.mire.intro=Ugh, a stinking bog. As like as not there's little glory to be had here. Just killing disgusting swamp creatures and getting filthy in the process.
encounter.start.easy=Let's charge and scatter them!
encounter.start.hard=Gather your courage. Our names will be remembered in legend!
encounter.start.normal=To arms!
encounter.win.easy=They were no match for us.

ally.dies.female=She's better off dead.
ally.dies.male=Attrition is inevitable.
badly.wounded=My time is near.
character.recruited=Let's get this over with.
condition.blind=I have killed in darkness before.
condition.disease=This one feels chronic and terminal.
condition.fear=Oh crap!
condition.hex=I'm feeling my efficiency impaired by something.
condition.insane.1=Suddenly everything is crystal clear to me...
condition.insane.2=You're all in it together, aren't you?
condition.insane.3=Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean that you're not out to get me...
condition.irritate=Damn, I'm going to kill you for that.
condition.nausea=Feels like after my first assassination.
condition.plyze=Don't let them stick a knife in my ribs while I'm down.
condition.poison=A tainted blade. Cunning.
condition.web=Damn, I'm caught!
default.aenen.city.intro=Getting out will be difficult, if they decide to keep us here. Most of these guys are carrying, and they probably know their way around better than us.
default.aenen.outskirts.charred.stump=This is massive overkill for a single tree.
default.aenen.outskirts.solar.panel.discovery=It doesn't look like much use as a weapon.
default.dalen.intro=The silence... We're being hunted. I can feel it.
default.danaos.castle.intro=These guys are well armed. I guess they're expecting trouble. Let's not be that trouble - I don't think I can kill them all in one go. 
default.danaos.dungeon.intro=Well, we all have our secrets. Let's see what these guys are hiding down here. I bet it's dangerous.
default.danaos.village.intro=This looks pretty peaceful. Let's move on.
default.gatehouse.1=It appears that the entrance to the Second Realm is some sort of dungeon. Fair enough, several less pleasant alternatives spring to mind.%n%nThe floor in this room is dusty and no foot prints or other disturbances are evident.  Whoever the denizens of this Realm are, they do not seem to frequent this part of it.
default.gatehouse.angry.swarms=They say you can judge a dungeon by the size of its insect infestation.
default.gatehouse.block.golem=I don't think the old knife-in-the-ribs maneouver will work here. Anyone got a hammer and chisel?
default.gatehouse.dark.cobweb.area=Dark. Musty. Just the way I like it. Watch your step, everyone. No telling what might be lurking in these shadows.
default.gatehouse.deactivated.portal=Portals - always trouble. Just stay close, and keep your weapons ready if we activate it. You never know what's on the other side.
default.gatehouse.hidden.stuff.1=Something's been chewing on these bones. Probably not while he was alive. But see here - gouges in those ribs? A large knife in the back, maybe a small sword, and more than one blow.%n%nNice.
default.gatehouse.malignant.widows=Shhh... I don't like the silence that's coming from behind that door. It's a dangerous kind of silence.
default.gatehouse.shrine.garret=Garret. I wonder if he?s watching our backs today.
default.gatehouse.welcome.sign=At least we seem to have ended up where we planned to. 
default.gnoll.village.intro=Savages. But not to be underestimated. I saw no spoor - they have skilled woodcraft. Those gnolls that I can see all have weapons close at hand. Best we do the same.
default.hianbian.intro=This place seems steady enough. I have a lot of experience sneaking around corridors, this suits me fine.
default.hianbian.yenluo.encounter=This beast is using a Wing Chun kata of the Inner Circle. A style that involves flurries of punches. A good choice if you happen to have razor blades instead of fists.
default.ichiba.city.gnome.garden=A cute patch of grass this, for the middle of a slum. I wonder who looks after it?
default.ichiba.city.imogen.door=You don't get to build your tower straddling the city walls just because you like the view. I wonder who this Imogen is.
default.ichiba.city.imogen.tower.1=A thick layer of dust here, probably not the way this Imogen gets into the tower.
default.ichiba.city.intro=Looks like a rowdy, lawless place. Plenty of dark alleys and faceless victims here. I'll probably get along just fine.
default.ichiba.city.temple.of.dana.sign=It looks religious to me.
default.ichiba.city.temple.of.the_lady.sign=
default.ichiba.crossroad.hidden.stuff.1=Looks like we have remains from a bunch of people here. People who dies from violent injuries. Otherwise not much exciting.
default.ichiba.crossroad.intro=Well this is a cheery woodland scene. I don't believe it for a minute. Keep on your guard.
default.ichiba.crossroad.mantis.glen=Hey, what do you lot think the most dangerous thing in these woods is? How long do you think before we meet it?
default.ichiba.domain.south.shrine=We don't have time for meditation, or whatever you're supposed to do here. Let's keep moving.
default.ichiba.thieves.guild.door=This door is well worn and the landing well used. It's got some unusual markings that I think are a code of some kind, though I can't read them. I wonder who calls this place their own.
default.ichiba.villa.door=No doubt this is the house of some rich merchant. I bet there are guardians inside. Dangerous ones.
default.plain.of.pillars.intro=Not a lot of cover here. This place doesn't suit my fighting style.
default.ruins.of.hail.intro=Low light conditions. I sense danger!%n%nWell. Nothing attacked out of the blue. But I still feel that danger is not far off.
default.stygios.forest.faerie.circle=I don't fear the fey folk or their fungal circle. Let them do their worst.
default.stygios.forest.intro=Normally I'm the quietest thing around, but this forest gives me the creeps. Feels something out there is already stalking us.
default.stygios.forest.shrine=Nergal I recognise. This is a shrine to the god of death. Can't say he's ever done anything for me, though I've sent him plenty of visitors.
default.temple.of.the.gate.end=Well, we have slain, battled and sneaked our way to the ultimate prize - the Great Gate out of this Realm. No doubt the Third Realm will be even more dangerous.
default.tornado.mountain.dragon.cave=That stench... this was the lair of some kind of beast. Perhaps it will come back and find us here?
default.writhing.mire.intro=I guess that this sort of vista is why they call this part of the Realm the wastelands.
encounter.start.easy=Another bunch of suicidal idiots.
encounter.start.hard=Perhaps this is how it ends.
encounter.start.normal=Kill them all.
encounter.win.easy=Waste of my time.
encounter.win.hard=We're not dead. Yet.
encounter.win.normal=Somebody make sure they're all dead.
inventory.heavy.load=This will impair my efficiency.
inventory.premium.item=This will improve my efficiency.
last.man.standing=So this is what it comes to. I have no regrets.
melee.attack.1=Does this hurt?
melee.attack.2=Feel the pain.
melee.attack.3=Fear me.
personality.selected=I'll come. As long as there's a lot of killing.
resurrected=Death is patient. He will wait a little longer for me.
scouting.spot.stash=I think something is hidden here. One of you lot have a look around.
slay.foe.1=Stay down.
