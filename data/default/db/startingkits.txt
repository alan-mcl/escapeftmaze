description="Magic draws magic unto itself." You read this in your mothers journal on your sixteenth birthday. You had always thought you were lucky that you and your mother lived alone in the woods. Other children had far less fun without the forest on their doorstep.%n%nWhen your mother died you buried her and kept the house on your own. It was only years later when the magic came alive within you too%c that you learned your mother's secret - witchcraft. Magic drew magic%c and suddenly the forest that had been your playground grew dark and threatening.%n%nWith a heavy heart you were forced to leave your childhood home behind.

description=The Abbot Graves saved you from darkness and sin. He saw in you what even you yourself could not see and brought you into light and purity. The years you spent with the others of the Forty under his tutelage were the best of your life.%n%nWhen the day that the Abott had spoken of came you were ready. You armed yourselves and rode forth from the monastery for the first and last time. The Forty fell upon the creatures of the Maze at Caradam River and Armand's famous victory owed much to your actions.%n%nIt was not without a price. All of your comrades met their deaths that morning. As he lay dying after the battle the Abott told you that one always remained to find and train the next Forty. He said that as he had been chosen%c so too were you and that you were the one who would continue the order outside of the Maze...

description=Life in the village was pretty peaceful and you always dreamed of being a soldier. When the creatures of the Maze invaded and Armand raised his army you were one of those conscripted. You discovered that army life wasn't all you'd dreamed it to be.%n%nThankfully your stamina%c fleetness of foot and wits got you assigned to scouting and skirmishing duties. Thus it was that you spent most of the campaign away from the main forces and when the decisive action was fought at Caradam River you were nowhere near there.%n%nAfter being disbanded you had little taste for returning to village life and decided that since the Maze was clearly beatable you would have a go yourself.

In summer the rains come falling sideways in the east wind and turn the hills into a labyrinth of flash floods and mud slides. Life isn't easy%c but you've always liked the open spaces and the silence.%n%nSome crofters and small villages eke out a living in these hard lands%c but you've preferred to keep on the move. Hunter%c trapper%c guide%c trader - you've drifted through all of them%c and others beside.%n%nYour unease at staying still in life slowly crystalised into a realisation that it was time to leave the Hills behind.

description=The docks at Kilin are as cosmopolitan as it gets in the First Realm. For years you earned your bread busking on the corner outside the Goat and Tower inn. You were pretty good - Triton merchants would always pay for one of your shanties%c and Goblin vagrants would sometimes stop to listen to a jig instead of trying to rob you. Once a year at the harvest festival you'd set up a stall and add a few magic tricks to the performance. All told it wasn't a bad life.%n%nYou never really knew why the wanderlust hit you%c but the day it did you packed your bag and hit the road. Kilin suddenly seemed small and crowded and boring. You needed to move on.%n%nTimes were hard travelling the first Realm. You scaped a living off tips and charity%c but sleeping under the stars got old really quickly. You tried Janpur but left soon - the wanderlust again. While on the road to Ponang you started to realise that maybe you'd have to travel further than that to scratch this particular itch.

description=You always had a knack for magic of various kinds%c but mostly you had a quick wit and an eye for the main chance. Life on the streets of Ponang taught you that there are two types of people - the smart and the dead.%n%nYou hustled the shell game on corners near the Bazaar%c you busked on the stairs of the Three Gates and you performed for an honest living where you could in dives and cheap theaters around the Sprawl. Life was fast and fun but you always dreamed of more.%n%nOne day working the docks a mysterious stranger saw through your shell game tricks and told you to follow your heart or lose it to the Maze. You surprised even yourself by leaving Ponang forever that night.

description=Everyone considered you fortunate to have been apprenticed a famous smith like Sergei%c but you had always dreamed of a life of adventure. You undoubtably had a talent for smithcraft - this Sergei had seen at once - but life in the village bored you. %n%nStill you tried to be a dutiful student to the old man and learned much from his patient teachings. In the year of the Lizard when the creatures of the Maze came against many domains your village was engulfed in the conflict. Sergei was slain and the smithy burned to the ground.%n%nAfter the war had moved on you were left with nothing holding you there and decided to pursue the adventure that you had always dreamed of.

description=You always knew that the calculus was impossible. The conjunction of planes needed to create the Maze was never feasible no matter which way you calculated it. This many pocket domains%c this many different shards of so many different worlds so far separated in physical space? This many gates needing magical power? Madness!%n%nThe more you learned from books the more your intuition was validated. It was obvious. You spent your days on street corners trying to explain this to everyone you could%c but nobody would listen. You could feel the answers encoded in the elemental powers flowing through you%c but everyone else seemed oblivious.%n%nIt became clear that they could not be saved%c and you began to prepare to escape from this mad prison without them.
