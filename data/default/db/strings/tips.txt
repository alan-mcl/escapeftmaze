tip_0=The guild already contains six characters that are ready to add to your party. Using them (or Quick Start) you can skip character creation and dive right in.
tip_1=Right click on almost anything to get more information.
tip_2=Your party will need a balance of combat, stealth and magic skills to survive.
tip_3=Any character race can become any character class, but some combinations are better than others.
tip_4=Purple magic spells can only be used by female characters. This prevents other genders from becoming Witches, Amazons, Cultists or Courtesans.
tip_5=Red magic spells can only be used by male characters. This prevents other genders from becoming Sorcerers, Warlocks, Magicians or Samurai.
tip_6=Each weapon has associated attack modes like Swing and Thrust. A character benefits from the related modifiers when using the weapon in combat.
tip_7=Stealthy characters can use their Backstab and Snipe modifiers to attack with appropriate weapons. These attacks cost action points but cause double damage if they hit.
tip_8=Characters have three resources: hit points, action points and magic points.
tip_9=Hit points, action points and magic points regenerate over time; quickly while resting, slowly otherwise.
tip_10=A varying amount of each colour of magic is available at each tile. Most spells have a colour requirement that must be met before they can be cast.
tip_11=The party's overall stealth level depends on the terrain type and the related stealth modifiers of each party member.
tip_12=Characters can unlock new modifiers at level up, and improve existing ones by practising them between level ups.
tip_13=Characters can change class at level up.
