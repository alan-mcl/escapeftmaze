tip_0=The guild already contains six characters that are ready to add to your party. Using them you can skip character creation and dive right in.
tip_1=Right click on almost anything to get more information.
tip_2=Your party will need a balance of combat, stealth and magic skills to survive.
tip_3=Any character race can become any character class, but some combinations are better than others.
tip_4=Witchcraft spells can only be used by female characters. This prevents other genders from becoming Witches, Amazons, Cultists or Gypsies.
tip_5=Sorcery spells can only be used by male characters. This prevents other genders from becoming Sorcerers, Warlocks, Magicians or Samurai.
tip_6=Each weapon has associated attack modes like Swing and Thrust. A character benefits from the related modifiers when using the weapon in combat.
tip_7=Stealthy characters can use their Backstab and Snipe modifiers to attack with appropriate weapons. These attacks cost stealth points, but cause double damage if they hit.
tip_8=Characters have three resources: hit points, stealth points and magic points.
tip_9=Hit points regenerate over time; quickly while resting, slowly otherwise.
tip_10=Stealth points can be replenished by hiding, or by moving around. Resting resets them to near zero, as does attacking normally (not backstabbing or sniping).
tip_11=Magic points regenerate over time; quickly while resting, slowly otherwise.
