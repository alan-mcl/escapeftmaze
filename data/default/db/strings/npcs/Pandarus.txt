maze\ master=9|I have little time for big tales.
garret=9|I have little time for religion.
faerie=9|I have little time for big tales.
aenen=9|Aenen, the greatest city in the Second Realm. The products of our craftsmen and machinists are sought after throughout the lands. Our defenses are second to none. If I sound prideful, it is merely because I speak the truth.
hail=9|Hail fell years ago. A pity, there was good trade to be had with that outpost. A risky route, but such brings great reward.
broken\ fang=9|I do not know him.
wastelands,wastes,wilds=9|Beyond Aenen and Danaos the lands of the Realm are increasingly risky. Since the fall of Hail I have had no cause to run caravans through them.
asius=9|Yes, he trades outside the gate. Risky, risky but lucrative. You will of course find fare superior wares here within Ichiba.
gate=9|I have no doubt that your journey to the gate will be long and ardous. Why not stock a little tobacco? It greatly refreshes and restores the weary traveller.
belisarius=9|I have heard that the Leonal General is most discerning in his choice of pipe weed.
mentes=9|A good fellow. His smithy is nearby.
agenor=9|Never heard of him.
beiweh=9|I have little time for religion.
nergal=9|I have little time for religion.
three\ eyes=9|I do not know him.
buy,deal,deals,sell,trade=9|Yes, you have come to right place. I stock the widest variety of tobacco and the related accoutrements and utilities in the Second Realm.
lorelei=9|I do not know her.
diomedes=9|I do not know him.
fangorn=9|I have little time for big tales.
third\ realm=9|I would give much to a caravan that could go there and return. It is not believed to be possible, but sometimes I wonder...
first\ realm=9|I have heard that the First Realm is much larger than the Second. More populous, more cities, more trade. A caravan that could make the journey, and return, would reap great reward\!
thee,thou,you,yourself=9|My name is Pandarus, renowned as a tobacconist and gentlegnome throughout the Realm.
pipe,smoke,tobacco,weed=9|Yes, tobacco, called pipe weed by the vulgar. A fine herb, a speciality of mine. You will not find better for sale anywhere in the Realm.
fuck,fuck\ you=9|Mind your language children.
quest,quests=9|I know of no such things.
bye,farewell,goodbye=9|Farewell, come again soon\!
danaos=9|That is the castle of the Leonals. I have not been there.
scrymgeour=9|I have been to his tavern in Ichiba, the beer was quite palatable.
c.o.c.,chamber\ of\ commerce,coc=9|They run trade in Ichiba. Heartless, thieving soundrels they are. Exorbitant taxes, truly exorbitant\! On both imports and exports\! An ineffective at preventing crime and corruption, despite their monopoly. Alas, one must deal with them as one best can.
thank\ you,thanks=9|The pleasure is all mine.
wasid=9|I have little time for religion.
ichiba=9|The city of Ichiba is the busiest in the Realm. A stinking hole, but a lucrative market. I export much tobacco there.
red\ ear=9|I have met the gnoll merchant in Ichiba. He's not the sharpest arrow in the quiver, so to speak.
glaucus=9|Yes, he is in Ichiba. I organise my caravans through him, his rates are very reasonable.
maze=9|The ways of the Maze are beyond my ken, I am a humble merchant seeking to make the best of this world we are in.
rumors,rumour,rumours=9|I know of no such thing.
escape,freedom=9|Some dream of escape in the future. I dream of profit in the present.
gentlemen's\ social\ club,thieves,thieves\ guild=9|
leonal,leonals,white\ order=9|Yes, the Leonals. Hostilities preclude much trade with them. A pity.
gnoll,gnolls=9|The gnolls are too savage to appreciate good tobacco. They smoke all manner of heathen herbs, whatever fragant plant they can burn.
dalen=9|I know nothing of that.
stentor=9|I believe that is the name of a Leonal smith in Danaos.
gnome,gnomes=9|The craft of the gnomes is unsurpassed. Particularly in the art of tobacco. Have you tried Aenen Cavegrown? Mine is the freshest that you will find, direct from the caverns where it is cultivated and hand picked so that the best leaves are sold domestically.
imogen=9|That is the name of the witch in Ichiba. I know little of her.
pickett,we\ pickett=9|He runs the Chamber of Commerce in Ichiba. A small minded man, a soulless bean counter. I hope he chokes on his next cigar\!
dana=9|I have little time for religion.
mnesus=9|Our glorious king. I have nothing ill to say, his policies are wise and his taste in tobacco is impeccable.
second\ realm=9|Many complain, but where others see the dangers of the Second Realm I see opportunity.
