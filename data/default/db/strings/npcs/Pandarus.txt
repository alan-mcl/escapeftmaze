aello=9|I have little time for religion.
aenen=9|Aenen, the greatest city in the Second Realm. The products of our craftsmen and machinists are sought after throughout the lands. Our defenses are second to none. If I sound prideful, it is merely because I speak the truth.
agenor=9|Never heard of him.
asius=9|Yes, he trades outside the Gate. Risky, risky but lucrative. You will of course find fare superior wares here within Ichiba.
beiweh=9|I have little time for religion.
belisarius=9|I have heard that the Leonal General is most discerning in his choice of pipe weed.
broken\ fang=9|I do not know him.
buy,deal,deals,sell,trade=9|Yes, you have come to right place. I stock the widest variety of tobacco and the related accoutrements and utilities in the Second Realm.
bye,farewell,goodbye=9|Farewell, come again soon\!
c.o.c.,chamber\ of\ commerce,coc=9|They run trade in Ichiba. Heartless, thieving soundrels they are. Exorbitant taxes, truly exorbitant\! On both imports and exports\! An ineffective at preventing crime and corruption, despite their monopoly. Alas, one must deal with them as one best can.
dalen=9|I know nothing of that.
danaos=9|That is the castle of the Leonals. I have not been there.
diomedes=9|I do not know him.
escape,freedom=9|Some dream of escape in the future. I dream of profit in the present.
faerie=9|I have little time for big tales.
fangorn=9|I have little time for big tales.
first\ realm=9|I have heard that the First Realm is much larger than the Second. More populous, more cities, more trade. A caravan that could make the journey, and return, would reap great reward\!
fuck,fuck\ you=9|Mind your language children.
garret=9|I have little time for religion.
gate=9|I have no doubt that your journey to the Gate will be long and ardous. Why not stock a little tobacco? It greatly refreshes and restores the weary traveller.
gentlemen's\ social\ club,thieves,thieves\ guild=9|
glaucus=9|Yes, he is in Ichiba. I organise my caravans through him, his rates are very reasonable.
gnoll,gnolls=9|The gnolls are too savage to appreciate good tobacco. They smoke all manner of heathen herbs, whatever fragant plant they can burn.
gnome,gnomes=9|The craft of the gnomes is unsurpassed. Particularly in the art of tobacco. Have you tried Aenen Cavegrown? Mine is the freshest that you will find, direct from the caverns where it is cultivated and hand picked so that the best leaves are sold domestically.
greetings,hello,hi,salutations=9|Greetings, how may I help you?
hail=9|Hail fell years ago. A pity, there was good trade to be had with that outpost. A risky route, but such brings great reward.
ichiba=9|The city of Ichiba is the busiest in the Realm. A stinking hole, but a lucrative market. I export much tobacco there.
imogen=9|That is the name of the witch in Ichiba. I know little of her.
kay,sir\ kay=9|I hear he is a wanted criminal in Ichiba.
lady=9|I have little time for religion.
leonal,leonals,white\ order=9|Yes, the Leonals. Hostilities preclude much trade with them. A pity.

maze=9|The ways of the Maze are beyond my ken, I am a humble merchant seeking to make the best of this world we are in.
maze\ master=9|I have little time for big tales.
mentes=9|A good fellow. His smithy is nearby.
mnesus=9|Our glorious king. I have nothing ill to say, his policies are wise and his taste in tobacco is impeccable.
nergal=9|I have little time for religion.
pickett,we\ pickett=9|He runs the Chamber of Commerce in Ichiba. A small minded man, a soulless bean counter. I hope he chokes on his next cigar\!
pipe,smoke,tobacco,weed=9|Yes, tobacco, called pipe weed by the vulgar. A fine herb, a speciality of mine. You will not find better for sale anywhere in the Realm.
quest,quests=9|I know of no such things.
red\ ear=9|I have met the gnoll merchant in Ichiba. He's not the sharpest arrow in the quiver, so to speak.

sarpedon=9|The guildmaster's barracks are nearby here. They are regular customers\!
scrymgeour=9|I have been to his tavern in Ichiba, the beer was quite palatable.
second\ realm=9|Many complain, but where others see the dangers of the Second Realm I see opportunity.
stentor=9|I believe that is the name of a Leonal smith in Danaos.
thank\ you,thanks=9|The pleasure is all mine.
thee,thou,you,yourself=9|My name is Pandarus, renowned as a tobacconist and gentlegnome throughout the Realm.
third\ realm=9|I would give much to a caravan that could go there and return. It is not believed to be possible, but sometimes I wonder...
three\ eyes=9|I do not know him.
wasid=9|I have little time for religion.
wastelands,wastes,wilds=9|Beyond Aenen and Danaos the lands of the Realm are increasingly risky. Since the fall of Hail I have had no cause to run caravans through them.
