garret=9|I have little time for religion.
leonal,leonals,white\ order=9|Yes, the Leonals. Hostilities preclude much trade with them. A pity.
maze=9|The ways of the Maze are beyond my ken, I am a humble merchant seeking to make the best of this world we are in.
sarpedon=9|The guildmaster's barracks are nearby here. They are regular customers\!

c.o.c.,chamber\ of\ commerce,coc=9|They run trade in Ichiba. Heartless, thieving soundrels they are. Exorbitant taxes, truly exorbitant\! On both imports and exports\! An ineffective at preventing crime and corruption, despite their monopoly. Alas, one must deal with them as one best can.

fangorn=9|I have little time for big tales.
gnome,gnomes=9|The craft of the gnomes is unsurpassed. Particularly in the art of tobacco. Have you tried Aenen Cavegrown? Mine is the freshest that you will find, direct from the caverns where it is cultivated and hand picked so that the best leaves are sold domestically.
second\ realm=9|Many complain, but where others see the dangers of the Second Realm I see opportunity.
gnoll,gnolls=9|The gnolls are too savage to appreciate good tobacco. They smoke all manner of heathen herbs, whatever fragant plant they can burn.

pipe,smoke,tobacco,weed=9|Yes, tobacco, called pipe weed by the vulgar. A fine herb, a speciality of mine. You will not find better for sale anywhere in the Realm.
aenen=9|Aenen, the greatest city in the Second Realm. The products of our craftsmen and machinists are sought after throughout the lands. Our defenses are second to none. If I sound prideful, it is merely because I speak the truth.
bye,farewell,goodbye=9|Farewell, come again soon\!
gentlemen's\ social\ club,thieves,thieves\ guild=9|
