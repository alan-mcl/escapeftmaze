garret=9|My sort of godling, Garret. Sometimes I would offer him a prayer..but, well, you know...I'm too busy counting loot. <grins broadly>
leonal,leonals,white\ order=9|The tall lion folk. They're all about soldiering and law and order... I personally think that they're compensating for something... And that goddess of theirs... pretty boring folks to talk to. Boring to rob, unless you're after armour polish and scriptures of Dana. Still, I hear there's a pile of loot in that castle of theirs...  Hmmm... now that I think about it...
maze=9|What's there to say? We all get by as best we can, according to our abilities. Some of us, just a little better than others\!
sarpedon=9|Never heard of 'im.
agenor=9|Never heard of 'im, thus couldn't care.
burglary,heist,rob=9|This is complicated game we play, personally, I just don't think you're up to it.
broken\ fang=9|Me Big Gnoll Chief\! Gnoll Smash\! Ha ha ha\! <wipes tear from his eye>
thee,thou,you,yourself=9|The name is Kay, Sir Kay. Humble chairman of the Ichiba Gentlemen's Social Club. A fine upstanding citizen, pillar of the community\! Ha ha ha\!
maze\ master=9|A legend, nothing more. But then again... so am I.
buy,deal,deals,sell,trade=9|Hem. I tend towards the five fingered discount, myself... on that note, suppose I could organize you what you need...?
c.o.c.,chamber\ of\ commerce,coc=9|Ah, the merchants. Sheep to our wolves.  <grins broadly>%n%nIt's an arms race, friends, but I'm always one step ahead. That fool Pickett and his army of hirelings couldn't catch a cold on a rainy day.
escape,freedom=9|Only if they catch you eh? Ha ha ha.
fuck,fuck\ you=9|Congratulations, you've just discovered the last resort of the stupid. <winks>
nergal=9|The gloomy god of death. There's always one like that. <shakes head>
belisarius=9|Yeah, the leonal general. Not widely known for his sense of humour, and always the last to get his own jokes.
kay,sir\ kay=9|A legendary being... me. Ha ha ha\!
glaucus=9|A cheery fellow, likeable enough for a gnome. I once permanently borrowed his purse when he passed out drunk at Scrymgeours\! Found love notes from two different wenches back at Aenen, of all things\! Ha ha ha\!  Also, he cheats at cards. But not as well as me... not that I cheat at all\! Wanna wager a hand or three...?
wastelands,wastes,wilds=9|Yes, people call the dangerous places of this Realm the wastes. I don't go there. No treasure, no profit, no fun. Blah\!%n
red\ ear=9|The gnoll shopkeeper in town? Not so bright, that one, but then none of them are. Nothing much worth stealing.
fangorn=9|Never heard of 'im, so can't be much.
gnome,gnomes=9|The wee little gnomes talk a good fight, but they prefer to let their machines and magic do the work, while they sit around quaffing ale and telling tall tales\! Ha ha ha\!
second\ realm=9|The Second Realm. More interesting than the First, less dangerous than the Third.
gnoll,gnolls=9|The dog warriors are a tedious bunch, all growling and barking and fighting. Still, easy enough to mislead if you have the need.
pickett,we\ pickett=9|A beaurocrat born and bred. I swear, he could probably calculate compound interest in his sleep\! Ha ha ha\! I may be planning a heist on his fancy waterfront mansion some time soon... depending on a number of things... You interested?
imogen=9|Yeah, the witch in the Tower. A shapely one that... But you'd have to gag her first... or perhaps a silence spell\! Ha ha ha\! Seriously though, she and the gnolls have got some sort of thing going on. Not sure what, but there's something up there.
ichiba=9|It's a good town. Bit tedious, now that the Chamber is trying to run things instead of letting nature take it's course. But still, the best we have. Better, I wager, than most of your precious First Realm towns.
thank\ you,thanks=9|Ha ha ha, the treasure... uhm, I mean, the pleasure is all mine\!
bet,cards,cheat,gamble,play=9|Tell you what, let's flip a coin\: heads I win, tails you lose? 
diomedes=9|The stiff in the temple? I haven't... uhm... taken my liberties with his moveable possessions yet, alas, the cult of Dana prefers austerity. I find more reason... and profit... in the religious orders that practise the accumulation of copious amounts of wealth. <grins broadly>
aello=9|Who would you pray to in a foxhole?
mentes=9|Never heard of 'im. Couldn't really care.
faerie=9|Never heard of it. Is it valuable?
scrymgeour=9|The inn keeper, a good enough fellow. He works for the Chamber of Commerce, thinks that nobody knows. Every so often we give him some useless information to pass on. Makes good beer though.
mnesus=9|Yeah, he's called the King of All Gnomes. A champion drinker and womaniser, I've heard. The benefits of royalty, ha ha ha\!
greetings,hello,hi,salutations=9|Hey you...
dalen=9|Never heard of it, so can't be much.
third\ realm=9|I haven't heard anything good. Give my the warm wenches of Ichiba any day.
asius=9|Never heard of 'im.
lorelei=9|I've heard there's a druidess of that name, wandering around somewhere.
first\ realm=9|Not really interested, to be honest. A place much like a smashed window in a brothel\: fucking broke.
dana=9|Heh, a shapely goddess she is, if she would just lose the armour and the scowl. I think she needs someone to show her a good time...%n%n
three\ eyes=9|He's the gnoll shaman.
information,rumors,rumour,stories,tales=9|Listen, I've lived longer than you could imagine and the only thing that really exists is that tale that you create. I would tell you mine...but you wouldn't believe it. <grins>
hail=9|Mighty stupid idea to build a city in the wastelands, wasn't it? Where's the profit in that? The Maze sent a bunch of beasties, there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth, now there is no more Hail.%n%nStill, it was a fun town while it lasted. There was an epic pub there, the Black Dog Inn. Good times\! Let's just say that there would be a few little Kay's running around in Hail, if the baddies hadn't come and wiped it out\! Ha ha ha\!
stentor=9|Can't be worth my time, as I've never heard of 'im.
quest,quests=9|Ha ha ha. Get rich or die trying? <grins>
beiweh=9|Heh, the goddess of farmers and their chubby wives.
aenen=9|The gnomes are fiendishly proud of their underground city. I prefer Ichiba... more loose items.
bye,farewell,goodbye=9|Later...
gentlemen's\ social\ club,thieves,thieves\ guild=9|Aaaah... the Gentlemen's Social Club of Ichiba. I am the humble chairman. <winks> We're a grouping of upstanding fellows interested in a bit of adventure and profit - with some fun and laughs thrown in. The humourless penny pinchers in the Chamber of Commerce hate us, only because jealousy makes them nasty. Ha ha ha\!
gate=9|Sure, there's a gate to the Third Realm somewhere in the wastes. Gimme some coinage and we'll flip about where is it... As an honest guy I should inform you, though, that you'll likely get killed before you get there. And even if you do, word is the Third Realm has little to recommend it.
danaos=9|That big drafty pile of stones is what the leonals call home.
wasid=9|The war god. All about gore and glory. Probably making up for his small package. Ha ha ha\!
