garret=9|May he bless us with luck.
leonal,leonals,white\ order=9|The high and mighty lion folk, always marching this way and that, building fortifications, planning wars.
maze=9|Honestly, I'm pretty comfortable where I am.
sarpedon=9|Nope, dunno.
agenor=9|Nope, dunno.
broken\ fang=9|He's the big chief gnoll, lord of their little village near here. Heh.
rumors,rumour,rumours=9|I've heard that drinking beer make you forget your troubles\! Har har har.
thee,thou,you,yourself=9|I am Scrymgeour, inn keeper and brewer.
maze\ master=9|Heh. You adventurers are all the same. Stories of shadowy forces, watching your every move, secret conspiracies of vast forces moving mysteriously against you? Har har har\! Have another beer and tell me more about it\!
buy,deal,deals,sell,trade=9|I've got some new stuff, have a look.
c.o.c.,chamber\ of\ commerce,coc=9|The C.O.C. keeps the city working. Law and order, regulated trade, standards and accountability. It would be chaos here without Pickett and his men.
escape,freedom=9|I hear it's to be found in the bottom of a beer mug. Har har.
fuck,fuck\ you=9|Beer is a little strong for you, I see. How about an orange juice?
nergal=9|<make a hand sign of protection against evil>%n%nMay he turn his gaze elsewhere\!
belisarius=9|He's the Leonal General, probably at their castle Danaos.
kay,sir\ kay=9|Bah, he's the worst of the brigands. There's a bag of gold on his head, if you see him.
glaucus=9|The gnome tinker? Calls himself a diplomat, but I'm not sure he knows what the word means\! Har har har.
wastelands,wastes,wilds=9|Ah yes. Most of this Realm is a waste. Rather stay here in Ichiba.
red\ ear=9|Damn dirty dog, trying to set up shop in town. He's got no idea about income tax, levies, rental. Raises a stink every month when he's due to the Chamber. Don't know why they still put up with it.
fangorn=9|Nope, dunno.
gnome,gnomes=9|Little mischief makers, not to be trusted. Good customers though - like their spirits, and tend to fall asleep under the table rather than starting a fight later on.
second\ realm=9|Most of it is a waste, monsters and beasts and such. Then there's the leonals and the gnomes, always bickering with eachother. And the damn dog soldiers, sneaking around in the forest. We've got a good thing going in Ichiba, stick around here and you'll be ok.
gnoll,gnolls=9|Them dogs are savages, dirty rascals with no morals. These days I try keep them out of the place, all they do is get drunk and start fights. Nasty fights too. Bah, they should stay in the damn forest.%n%nTake that Red Ear, the junk seller across the road\! Why the Chamber let's him ply his trade and sell his useless rubbish in town, I don't know.
pickett,we\ pickett=9|A good man, fair and honest. Runs the C.O.C. like a tight ship, got his finger on the pulse. This city would fall apart without him.
imogen=9|<makes a hand sign of protection against evil> %n%nGods protect us from whatever dark forces that witch is toying with in ther tower\! The Chamber should run her out of town, I always say. There's no place for sorcery in an organised town.
ichiba=9|A smallish town, but a good one. Lots of trade, lots of buzz. The pace here is quicker than many folk like, but myself, I love it. Love my job. Not bad for a prison, this part of the Maze. Har har har.
thank\ you,thanks=9|My pleasure.

mentes=9|Nope, dunno.
faerie=9|Nope, dunno.
scrymgeour=9|Yep, that's me, your humble servant\!

greetings,hello,hi,salutations=9|What can I do for you?
dalen=9|Nope, dunno.
third\ realm=9|I hear all kinds of tales. Giants the size of mountains. Black nights on blazing steeds. Carniverous rabbits the size of horses, with glowing red eyes\! Swarms of tiny machines, each hungry for blood\!%n%nHar har har. Have another beer and let's talk about it.
asius=9|Nope, dunno.
lorelei=9|Nope, dunno.
first\ realm=9|Well done on escaping\! Back home, you'd be a legend. Here, you're just another unemployment statistic. Har har har. How about a beer?
dana=9|May she bless and protect us.
three\ eyes=9|The witchdoctor of the gnolls? Why d'ye ask - looking for a love potion? Or, something to cure your boils or make your hair grow back? Har har har.
hail=9|Aye, the city in the wastelands. It has fallen now. The makes the Adventurers Arms the best pub in the Realm\!

quest,quests=9|Har har har. Here's your quest\: have another beer\!
beiweh=9|Her blessings on our produce. Especially my beer. Har har har.
aenen=9|Yep, the gnomish city? It's to the south, and under the ground.
bye,farewell,goodbye=9|Bye.
gentlemen's\ social\ club,thieves,thieves\ guild=9|Damn bandits. The C.O.C. keep hiring mercenaries, but the blasted brigands keep harassing us.
gate=9|There's a gate to the next Realm, somewhere. You'd do better to ask someone other than me though.
danaos=9|It's a big castle, with a small village. North of here. You'd better be on good terms with the leonals if you head up that way.
wasid=9|May his blessing give us strength.
