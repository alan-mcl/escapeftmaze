garret=9|I don't really have time for that sort of thing.
leonal,leonals,white\ order=9|The lion folk, always stalking around in the clanking armour. Most of them are pious and honest to a fault, thanks to that humourless goddess they worship. Running caravans out to their castle Danaos is a bit tedious - they have little grasp of the the niceties of modern economics. I once spent hours explaining compound interest to their quartermaster... and a month later he flew into a rage when I sent him a bill\!
maze=9|Yes, we are all stuck in the Maze, aren't we.
sarpedon=9|Don't know him.
agenor=9|Don't know him.
broken\ fang=9|He's the chief of the gnoll village. An ignorant brute.
rumors,rumour,rumours=9|I've heard that damn witch Imogen isn't as young as she looks, if you know what I mean.
thee,thou,you,yourself=9|I'm W E Pickett, Director of the Ichiba Chamber of Commerce. It's a thankless job, but I bear the burden willingly.
maze\ master=9|I don't really have time for that sort of thing.
buy,deal,deals,sell,trade=9|Yes, that's what I do. Not your sort though, why don't you see what Scrymgeour in town can do for you?
c.o.c.,chamber\ of\ commerce,coc=9|Trade is the lifeblood of Ichiba, and we control the trade. Everyone gets a fair deal, we take our cut, and provide logistical and security related services. Bottom line - goods keep moving. Can't have it any other way.
escape,freedom=9|I'm more interested in profit and loss, myself. To each his own.
fuck,fuck\ you=9|That's really not necessary.
nergal=9|I don't really have time for that sort of thing.
belisarius=9|The leonal boss. A good soldier, I'm sure. But his grasp of economics is lacking. We're not living in the dark ages any more, children are taught about compound interest in school these days.
kay,sir\ kay=9|He's blackguard of the worst sort - a rogue without morals or conscience, as lazy and shifty as they come. The local riff raff look up to him as some kind of leader, and he of course plays along and styles himself the Bandit King. Bah\! The sooner we clean them up the better.
glaucus=9|The little gnome tinker has a shop in town. He claims he is supposed to be some kind of embassy from the gnomes to Ichiba. If you ask me, he's just a smooth talking con man.
wastelands,wastes,wilds=9|Beyond the Crater lie the wastelands. No civilisation these days, though we used to run caravans out to Hail City, before it fell.
red\ ear=9|That's the gnoll who opened a shop in town recently. He's having some trouble with basic concepts like rent, tax and trading licenses. Damn savage gnolls, they should just stay in the forest.
fangorn=9|Don't know him.
gnome,gnomes=9|We run caravans out to the little folk, in their city Aenen. They're a reasonable trading partner, but their record keeping is horrendous. Best not to let them get into debt, because tomorrow morning they'll have woken up and forgotten about it\!
second\ realm=9|There's little civilisation here, just what you see in the Crater. Not much of a market. But, people need goods, and the caravans must run.
gnoll,gnolls=9|Those savage dog people would be more of a problem, if they weren't so stupid. As it is, the expenditure to distract them from our caravans is minimal.
pickett,we\ pickett=9|Yes, that's me. Director of the Ichiba Chamber of Commerce.
imogen=9|Indeed I do know the green sorceress. Frankly, she's a nuisance. Always throwing her weight around, expecting special treatment, looking after her own ends. Having a witch working who-knows-what magicks in a lonely tower would be trying enough if she kept to herself, but it's insufferable when she tries to get involved in matters of economy and politics.
ichiba=9|Ichiba might be smallish, by the scale of cities in the First Realm. But it's the best we have in thie Realm. And it's not such a bad place - there's an appetite for trade in this Crater, and with the C.O.C. providing a helping hand the economy is thriving.
thank\ you,thanks=9|Not a problem.
diomedes=9|He's the leonal at the temple. Pretty typical of his sort - proud, stiff-upper-lip, all about prayers and soldiering.
aello=9|I don't really have time for that sort of thing.
mentes=9|Don't know him.
faerie=9|I don't really have time for that sort of thing.
scrymgeour=9|A good man. Runs the inn near the waterfront - he's your guy if you want a drink or a bed for the night.
mnesus=9|He's the boss of the gnomes, down south in Aenen.
greetings,hello,hi,salutations=9|Hello.
dalen=9|I don't really have time for that sort of thing.
third\ realm=9|I'd run a caravan there, if there was profit in it. But there isn't.
asius=9|Don't know him.
lorelei=9|Don't know her.
first\ realm=9|Well, I know the trade network we have here can't compare to what you're used to at home. But circumstances are different. This Realm is a lot wilder, a lot less of a civilised market to sell into. But we're doing what we can. It takes time to build up.
three\ eyes=9|I think that's the name of the so called shaman of the gnolls.
hail=9|We used to run caravans out to Hail, before my time in this position. But the city was sacked by a dragon. Bad for business, that. We don't send people out that way now. It's a pity, I was fond of the cider they made there.
stentor=9|Don't know him.
quest,quests=9|Not right now.
beiweh=9|I don't really have time for that sort of thing.
aenen=9|Yes, where the gnomes live. We run some caravans out that way.
lady=9|I don't really have time for that sort of thing.
bye,farewell,goodbye=9|Goodbye.
gentlemen's\ social\ club,thieves,thieves\ guild=9|Those blasted thieves are an incessant nuisance\! They're led by a fellow called Kay, who styles himself as some sort of glorified brigand king. Needless to say, their banditry comes straight off our bottom line. They have no regard for the hard work an honest merchant puts into making a living\!
gate=9|The great gate? Oh, I'm sure it's around somewhere. Try looking in the furthest, most dangerous part of the Realm that you can find. Ha ha ha.
danaos=9|An expensive construction project, that castle.
wasid=9|I don't really have time for that sort of thing.
