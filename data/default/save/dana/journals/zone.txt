Gatehouse
1~Arrived in Gatehouse
2~... you blink as the familiar disorientation of extradimensional travel wears off and your eyes adjust to the darkness. You appear to be in a gloomy stone corridor, and a dead end at that. The air is stale and heavy, and the oppresive silence is broken only by your breathing.
2~You look around. Some crudely etched runes on nearby walls emit a desultory glow, but otherwise this section of  corridor is unremarkable.%nThis gate seems to have been a one way trip: you can see no immediate way back to the First Realm from here...

55~The large lever mechanism looks tarnished and old but otherwise functional.%n%nYou wonder what hidden machinery it connects to...
55~You give the lever a hard yank.
55~A loud clanking and grinding fills the dungeon.
115~OUCH!
116~OUCH!
149~OUCH!
160~Large silky webs cover the walls and recede around the corner.
168~This area of the dungeon is even dustier, gloomier and more run down than what you have seen so far.%n%nFrom the darkness you seem to feel many eyes watching you through the strands of webbing.
