Gatehouse
1~Arrived in Gatehouse
2~... you blink as the familiar disorientation of extradimensional travel wears off and your eyes adjust to the darkness. You appear to be in a gloomy stone corridor, and a dead end at that. The air is stale and heavy, and the oppresive silence is broken only by your breathing.
2~You look around. Some crudely etched runes on nearby walls emit a desultory glow, but otherwise this section of  corridor is unremarkable.%nThis gate seems to have been a one way trip: you can see no immediate way back to the First Realm from here...
10~Above you a fixture on the ceiling gives off some kind of soft magical light.
14~Peering through the bars, the room beyond is gloomy and quiet. A dank, feral smell faintly tickles your nose.%n%nOn the far side of the room you can just make out what looks like some kind of lever.
18~Above you a fixture on the ceiling gives off some kind of soft magical light.
34~With a flurry of wings, you are suddenly assaulted from above!
34~Encountered Fruit Bats 
34~COMBAT!
34~--- combat round 1 starts ---
35~--- combat round 1 ends ---
35~Victory!
39~The large lever mechanism looks tarnished and old but otherwise functional.%n%nYou wonder what hidden machinery it connects to...
39~You give the lever a hard yank.
39~A loud clanking and grinding fills the dungeon.
