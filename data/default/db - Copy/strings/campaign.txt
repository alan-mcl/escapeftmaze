default.intro.1 = Many generations ago your ancestors were cast into the Maze. For sins or crimes that you do not remember they were exiled from their own time and place. They did not know the origins of the Maze, but it became their jail and their jailer. Few ever escaped it's clutches.
default.intro.2 = You were born into this captivity. You spent your youth wandering the domains and gates of First Realm. Always you felt the eyes of the Maze upon you. The Maze watched but seldom acted, for most of the first Realm is safe. Such is the nature of the prison.
default.intro.3 = Many others shared your fate, but few were willing to risk escaping. You were different. For you the injustice of your fate always burned brightly. Ever your eyes were set towards the forbidden domains at the center of the First Realm, for you knew that there lay passage from this realm to the second.
default.intro.4 = And so you gathered what equipment and like minded comrades you could and left safety behind. You passed through the guarded gates and departed from the inhabited domains of the first Realm. And so the eyes of the Maze were turned upon you, and the will of the Maze began to move against you.
default.intro.5 = The journey was long and hard. You were beset by hazards and foes you could barely have imagined before you left. But at long last you came to the chamber of the Great Gate atop a unnamed windswept mountain, and defeated in battle the guardian beast left there to watch over it.
default.intro.6 = The passage to the Second Realm lies open. Without hesitation, you step through the first Great Gate and forever leave the domains of your birth behind you...
