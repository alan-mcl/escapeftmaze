Whispered rumours told you of those before you that had left the First Realm to try their hand at escaping the Maze. None have ever returned.\n\nAnd so you gathered what equipment and like minded comrades that you could and left your home behind, setting out into the wild areas in the centre of the First Realm where none dared tread. The journey was long and hard, beset by hazards and foes you could barely have imagined before you left, but you prevailed and at long last came to the chamber of the Gate atop a windswept unnamed mountain, and defeated in battle the guardian beast left there to watch over it.\n\nWithout hesitation, you step through the first Great Gate and forever leave the First Realm behind...
