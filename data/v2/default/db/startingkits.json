The shinobi of Naomasa Domain are not supermen. You should know, you\u0027ve killed a number of them.\n\nThe assassination business in Kilin was a competitive one; every yokel with a knife and low moral fiber was your rival. You were one of the best because you were smart. One of your edges you flaunted - the ninja myth. A few black clothes and some acrobatics and your employers and enemies both believed and paid their respective prices.\n\nEventually you\u0027d had enough killing, and when the opportunity presented itself you decided to try and escape from the Maze forever.",

Aboard the cutter Westwind you waylaid Kilin supply shipments, raided Triton villages and plundered where and when you could. Life was good, the seas were warm and the skies were blue.\n\nThis came to an end when Batholomew\u0027s ravages became intolerable and the three cities banded together to hunt him down. Many ships came against you, but Westwind was a swift vessel and kept ahead of the hunting pack for more than a month. Despite this, the hunters were tireless.\n\nEventually sensing the inevitable, Bartholomew siezed a hapless merchant, burned the Westwind and coasted through the pursuing ranks and into the port of Janpur. There you and the rest of the crew dispersed in search of new adventures.",

Only when you were tasked with kidnapping a newborn girl child did you understand how you came to be raised as a child of the moon. Surely this was not right?\n\nThe cult was a dangerous place for dissenters. You still believed!
