Personality: Cunning
Description: Brash and boastful. Impatient. Likes cities.
Example speech: 
"Now then, this is more like it! A lawless frontier town, full of the bold and the desperate. Easy marks and good times!  I'm practically tingling with excitment! There must be a cosy saloon or whorehouse nearby..."
"Search their pockets and let's get moving."
"Too bad nobody's left any valuable offerings here that we could take."
"Hmmm. I gots a feeling for doors. Not sure why, but this one feels different."
"See the thick layer of dust on this carpet? Nobody has walked this way for a long time."
"Ugh, not another dose of the pox."
"Oooo, haven't had a hangover like this in a while."
"Ha! See those small marks on the door? You don't really, huh? Ok. Well, those are secret signs in the language of Thieves. They say that this place is, or was, used by whatever local Guild owns this area.  We're on claimed turf here, lads. Best watch our step 'til we've sussed out the situation."
"There better be some good loot to be had after this."
"What am I supposed to do, blink them to death?"
"Who the hell comes out here to visit this shrine? Madness."
"Yowzer, what that thing is it looks pissed off!"
"Well, well, a mystical portal, huh? Don't worry, I'll have it activated in no time. Watch and learn."
"Ack, this itches like crabs!"
"I'll just frisk his pockets real quick."
"A walk over."
"I'll give y'all twelve to one odds on that being a normal statue. Takers?"
"Gee, big trees in this forest.   Don't like the look of it. Maybe we should go back to town..."
"Looks like this place has been sacked. Bummer - that usually means that the victors have carried off all the loot.  I'd have preferred to find a busy city here. Still, perhaps there are some caches that haven't been found yet..."
"Yeah, I'm your best bet for this gig."
"Hey, some kind of posh waterfont villa. Probably a good place to rob.  You lot create a distraction, I'll have a look at the lock..."
"You won't regret bringing me along."
"Dibs on her magic items."
"Could this be some sort of hidden temple, brimming with precious gems and golden idols? Or perhaps the hidden fortress of a long dead king, his copious wealth long uncounted by living hands. Or, maybe the winding tomb of some mad tyrant, stacked with funeral offerings?  Let's get going here people!"
"Not gonna lie to you, that dungeon was getting tedious.  Check out the road. Let's go that way, there might be a town or something."
"Damn, I'm stuck!"
"It don't look valuable to me. Leave it."
"I can't see anything! Gonna lay low..."
"Ugh, a disgusting bog. I'd much rather be back in the city."
"I'll just go see if he had any gold teeth."
"Thanks, I owe you one."
"Wow! This thing is ama..... I'll just keep this, it's probably not much use."
"Garret is my kinda godling - keeps to the shadows and doesn't ask too many questions."
"Ugh, this place reeks! Dark, dusty, and full of cobwebs. I prefer the vibrant streets of a city. Let's get through this mess quickly."
"Who do these guys think they are?"
"Hey there, I've got a lot of gold and magic items here. Maybe we can make some kind of deal?"
"Most of the loot will in that castle up there. Not much point stiffing these penniless peasants, let's go for the main stash."
"Right, some kinda cave. Let's keep going up the mountain."
"Yeeeee haaaaaa! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"Heh he heh he heh he heh!"
"So this is what the knight guys are hiding. Their own secret fox hole outta here. Nice"
"Whoa no! Anything but that!"
"Weeeeeeeeeee!"
"Well well, a underground city! Say, I don't see many foreigners here. Don't see any except us. So much for blending in.  Still, a city means trade and trade means wealth. And wealth is something that I admit to being quite fond of."
"Anyone got some extra bug spray, or are we just gonna squash 'em the old-fashioned way?"
"I am officially the stuff of legend! I never doubted that I'd be good enough to make it this far, but everyone else did. Ha! Proved 'em all wrong!  Onward to riches and fame in the Third Realm!"
"P'tah! Dust is already sticking in my mouth.  Don't think we'll find a cosy tavern anywhere here."
"Hey wait! There's something hidden here!"
"Think I've got another dose of the pox here."
"Should we really be messing about here in the woods? Let's go back and follow the road..."
"This ain't really my kinda scene. Savages - no sense of humour and less patience. And an annoying sense of honour and pride.  Doesn't look like much to see here, let's head back to the city."
"Hey, your shoelace is untied!"
"You lot go ahead, I'm right behind you."
"Take this!"
"Not sure I want to be inside the castle of a zealous religious order. Tends to be bad for business, if you know what I mean. Let's go back to that village outside the walls..."
"What's that behind you?"
"We don't have time to pick flowers. Let's go."
"I'm getting tired of doors. Kick it in and let's get going."
"Dibs on this one's purse!"
"One of you distract them, and I'll sneak around behind..."
"What the hell is wrong with me?"
"I always knew I was good! Here I am in the Second Realm - a legend in my own time! This Realm is probably ripe for the picking for an operator like me, they won't know what hit them.  Looks like nobody has been through here for a long time, which suggests a depressing lack of loot in this dungeon. Let's get outta here."
"Great, a murky forest, fill with hungry animals. Why are we here again? Dry branches everywhere... better watch our steps."
"I'll just frisk the dead guy real quick... Dead guys, that is."
"Where do you want me to put all these organs?"
"Looks like some kind of temple. Shall we rob it?"
"Gimme a break, I can't carry all this junk!"

Personality: Faithful
Description: Religious, faithful and yet pessimistic.
Example speech: 
"Her fate is now in the hands of the merciful gods. Rest in peace, sister."
"May his soul speed to the keeping of the gods. He was a fine man, a faithful fellow and a staunch friend to all who knew him. Rest in peace, brother."
"May the gods grant me forgiveness for my sins, fallible mortal that I am, and watch over my comrades when I am gone."
"Let us embark with good faith and courage."
"Darkness has no hold on my soul."
"I fear that this affliction is here to stay."
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil..."
"Some dark curse weighs on my soul."
"Heh heh heh he he he he."
"Eeee hee hee hee hee hee!"
"Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah!"
"Adventuring is always full of these little inconviences."
"I am sick to the pit of my stomach."
"I am immobilized. I will pray for us."
"I feel some kind of vile poison coursing through my veins."
"I am entangled and cannot move."
"So this is the hidden city of the gnomes. It has a solid, safe feeling to it that I find reassuring."
"I sense that some magic has been at work here."
"Amazing! I sense the overriding force of the Druidic magic here, permeating the forest. This is a holy place... a place like this are unlikely to welcome outsiders like ourselves."
"This is a mighty fortress. These must be dangerous lands to warrant this fortification.  Still, the leonals seem honest and trustworthy for that. Thank the gods that we can still find peoples of honour in the Maze."
"Sometimes it feels like we spend all our time going through doors and Gates."
"Let us offer up a prayer of thanks for our safe arrival in the Second Realm. Many have died striving for what we have achieved.  These surroundings are discouragingly dismal - a gloomy dungeon no doubt filled with blood thirsty foes of some sort."
"May the divine shield us from this creeping menace!"
"The statue radiates some kind of magic."
"A foreboding aura lingers here. Dark and dusty, like the trials we face. Pray for guidance, my friends, for the shadows may hold both danger and revelation."
"Ah, a portal of unknown destination. Defunct, yet I fear the path it would lead to may be darker than we imagine."
"May the gods grant his spirit peace, and forgive us for disturbing his remains."
"Dread fills my soul at the sight of this door."
"The Grey Wayfarer watches over the bold and the wary. We are in his domain now; let us honor him, for his protection often goes unseen but not unfelt."
"I have tried to bring faith to barbaric villages like this before, with precious little success. I expect no better here. Indeed, these infidels look lazier and more indolent than most that I have seen."
"I wonder if there may be any civilisation to be found in here? Friendly faces, a welcoming hearth? Probably not...  Something about this maze feels wrong to me. I feel a growing sense of dread and fear..."
"Oh my goodness! I sense evil, strong evil, in this creature."
"My skin tingles at the presence of some minor enchantment here."
"This door radiates strong magic."
"This rooms looks very run down."
"I am glad to see civilisation, even such an uncivilised example as this. To be honest, it's more than I expected to find in this Realm."
"This is the symbol of Dana, the Iron Goddess of Justice and Mercy. Bearing the spear of Truth in one hand and the shield of Faith in the other, she watches over the just and the downtrodden; patron of soldiers, pilgrims and peasants.   Her servants are inclined to be rather humourless, but unlikely to deal falsely with us."
"These remains appear to come from several humanoid individuals who died from various violent injuries, but are otherwise unremarkable to my eyes."
"Thank the gods for clean air and sunlight! We have passed through the first challenge of this new Realm.  I spy a road or path. Perhaps we can find some civilised areas?"
"I'm not sure it's wise to wander this far from the path."
"This shrine is dedicated to Garret. He is the ambivalent patron of heroes, adventurers and wayfarers; the cloaked one who stands guard before those who watch their own backs. The bat, the cat and the spider are his creatures; the road and the alleyway are his holy places."
"This seems a disreputable establishment. Let us not tarry here."
"This is a wealthy villa. Even in this town there are those who lord their wealth over others."
"What appalling devastation! This blood red sky glows like a scene from hell above a lifeless salt desert. I pray the gods grant us of preservation in the face of adversity."
"What horrifying devastation! Let us offer up a prayer for those who must have perished here."
"The ways of the fey are strange and unpredictable, sometimes for good and sometimes for evil. Here in this glade is one of their circles. We should let it be - leave the fey to their own."
"An oppressive place, mentally and spiritually. This forest looks as though little light has ever penetrated."
"This is a shrine to Nergal, the deathly god of the underworld - a god of emptiness and endings.  I haveseldom seem a shrine dedicated to this gloomy god in a more appropriate setting."
"Let us offer a fervant prayer of thanks for our preservation and progress this far. The Great Gate lies before us, no doubt more perils await in the next Realm."
"Yet another gloomy vista. I suspect that the path ahead leads nowhere."
"Be gentle with them."
"Let us pray for a miracle."
"They are merely misguided."
"Would that all our foes were that meek."
"Thank the gods for our miraculous victory!"
"We have been blessed with victory. The gods forgive us for our violence."
"I will bear the burden, irksome as it is."
"Blessed be."
"Rest in peace, brave comrades. I will continue as long as the gods will on my own."
"Sorry!"
"Get back!"
"Forgive me for this violence."
"I pray the gods will bless our endeavour."
"Blessed is the light of heaven, but my work here is not yet done."
"I think I see something concealed here..."
"Rest in peace."

Personality: Grunt
Description: The Grunt isn't much of a talker. Not much of a thinker, either.
Example speech: 
"I miss her."
"Oh no. He dead."
"It hurt!"
"I ready to go now."
"Me no see!"
"Uhn. Feel sick."
"Aaaaaaaaaa!"
"Something feel wrong."
"Har har har. Har."
"Hur hur hur hur hur.  Hur hur hur hur hur.  Hur hur hur hur hur hur!"
"Ack hur hur hur hur! Ack hur hur hur!"
"Itchy bites!"
"Bleh, feel yucky in tummy."
"Uh. Arms not working? Legs too."
"Not feeling so good..."
"Sticky stuff got me!"
"Big city, funny people."
"What this?"
"Big trees! Big!"
"Lots of lion guys in here..."
"What the lion guys got down here?"
"Hey, this place look lot like last place to me. Think more fighting here."
"Me squash bugs."
"Better smash it!"
"Ugh webs. Dark also."
"Huh what this?"
"No meat on this dead guy."
"Too many door! Me smash door!"
"Shrine to sneaky god. Me not trust him."
"Many dog men here. We be careful."
"Funny place this."
"Think insect guy wants to fight."
"What we doing here again?"
"Me break door down?"
"Who we meeting here again?"
"Uh, the city look very busy."
"What that sign mean?"
"These bones old and dry. Yuck!"
"We there yet? ... Oh, ok."
"Hey, maybe still danger in this forest..."
"We gonna nap here?"
"Me break it down for us?"
"Me break door down?"
"Hey, ground taste salty here! Bleh!"
"Don't think we find many people here."
"Mmm, mushies look tasty... We make stew?"
"This forest pretty quiet."
"Think we maybe not stop here..."
"We there yet? ... Oh, ok. We go then."
"Bleh, smell nasty in here."
"Ugh, little insects eating my face!"
"I crush!"
"Uh oh."
"I smash!"
"We crush them hard!"
"We smash them!"
"We crush them."
"Unnnnn. Is heavy."
"Shiny things nice!"
"This not go so well."
"Yar!"
"Grrr!"
"Smash!"
"Me like to come with you."
"Just now I see a bright light? Anyone else? What you all looking at?"
"Something secret here!"
"I crush!"

Personality: Gung Ho
Description: Bold and bravo. A bit of an Indiana Jones.
Example speech: 
"The biggest trouble with her was the noise."
"We've lost a good man today."
"This is usually when the ground falls out from beneath my feet."
"Ok people. We do not follow maps to buried treasure and X never, ever marks the spot."
"Don't worry, I've got a vivid imagination."
"It's not the years, honey; it's the mileage."
"Good god!"
"A foul curse."
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"WA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!"
"AAAAA!!! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HAH!"
"I'm covered with something itchy!"
"Feels like the time I didn't purify the drinking water properly."
"Why don't I just sit down? It'll be more comfortable."
"Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?"
"When I get outta this gunk I'm gonna come and break your head!"
"Second Realm, first impressions: not great. But hey, no turning back now! Letâ??s see what this dungeonâ??s hiding."
"Well, look who decided to join the party!"
"Hey, if it's just decoration, maybe we can nick a few gems off it."
"Dusty, cobweb-ridden halls! Reminds me of that crypt under Ponang. Fun times! Let's press on, the thrill awaits!"
"A portal? Fantastic! Let's get it going and get outta here!"
"Poor soul didnâ??t make itâ?¦ but we will."
"Smells like trouble on the other side. I bet there's something nasty waiting for us."
"Honor to the Wayfarer. Let's keep moving - there's more adventure ahead."
"Tropical paradise, eh? I bet there's a village or a hidden temple around here. Let's follow that path!"
"I think you just brought a knife to a gunfight, kid."
"Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory."
"Bring 'em on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneakin' around."
"Piece of cake."
"We were pretty lucky there people. Well, you lot were lucky, I was just good."
"You think they'd learn not to mess with the hero of the story."
"Why are we carrying all this crap?"
"Wow, that's a pretty trinket!"
"You want to talk to God? Let's go see him together, I've got nothing better to do."
"Hang on, lady, we're going for a ride."
"This is gonna hurt you a lot more than it's gonna hurt me."
"Eat lead, scum."
"Fortune and glory, kid. Gimme a torch and let's get going."
"Here I am, walking back through your door."
"Hey, let's look around a bit here and see what we can find!"
"Sorry about the mess."

Personality: Killer
Description: Fatalistic, gloomy and with a professional interest in killing.
Example speech: 
"She's better off dead."
"Attrition is inevitable."
"My time is near."
"Let's get this over with."
"I have killed in darkness before."
"This one feels chronic and terminal."
"Oh crap!"
"I'm feeling my efficiency impaired by something."
"Suddenly everything is crystal clear to me..."
"You're all in it together, aren't you?"
"Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean that you're not out to get me..."
"Damn, I'm going to kill you for that."
"Feels like after my first assassination."
"Don't let them stick a knife in my ribs while I'm down."
"A tainted blade. Cunning."
"Damn, I'm caught!"
"Getting out will be difficult, if they decide to keep us here. Most of these guys are carrying, and they probably know their way around better than us."
"This is massive overkill for a single tree."
"It doesn't look like much use as a weapon."
"The silence... We're being hunted. I can feel it."
"These guys are well armed. I guess they're expecting trouble. Let's not be that trouble - I don't think I can kill them all in one go."
"Well, we all have our secrets. Let's see what these guys are hiding down here. I bet it's dangerous."
"This looks pretty peaceful. Let's move on."
"It appears that the entrance to the Second Realm is some sort of dungeon. Fair enough, several less pleasant alternatives spring to mind.  The floor in this room is dusty and no foot prints or other disturbances are evident.  Whoever the denizens of this Realm are, they do not seem to frequent this part of it."
"They say you can judge a dungeon by the size of its insect infestation."
"I don't think the old knife-in-the-ribs maneouver will work here. Anyone got a hammer and chisel?"
"Dark. Musty. Just the way I like it. Watch your step, everyone. No telling what might be lurking in these shadows."
"Portals - always trouble. Just stay close, and keep your weapons ready if we activate it. You never know what's on the other side."
"Something's been chewing on these bones. Probably not while he was alive. But see here - gouges in those ribs? A large knife in the back, maybe a small sword, and more than one blow.  Nice."
"Shhh... I don't like the silence that's coming from behind that door. It's a dangerous kind of silence."
"Garret. I wonder if he?s watching our backs today."
"Savages. But not to be underestimated. I saw no spoor - they have skilled woodcraft. Those gnolls that I can see all have weapons close at hand. Best we do the same."
"This place seems steady enough. I have a lot of experience sneaking around corridors, this suits me fine."
"This beast is using a Wing Chun kata of the Inner Circle. A style that involves flurries of punches. A good choice if you happen to have razor blades instead of fists."
"A cute patch of grass this, for the middle of a slum. I wonder who looks after it?"
"You don't get to build your tower straddling the city walls just because you like the view. I wonder who this Imogen is."
"A thick layer of dust here, probably not the way this Imogen gets into the tower."
"Looks like a rowdy, lawless place. Plenty of dark alleys and faceless victims here. I'll probably get along just fine."
"It looks religious to me."
"Looks like we have remains from a bunch of people here. People who dies from violent injuries. Otherwise not much exciting."
"Well this is a cheery woodland scene. I don't believe it for a minute. Keep on your guard."
"Hey, what do you lot think the most dangerous thing in these woods is? How long do you think before we meet it?"
"We don't have time for meditation, or whatever you're supposed to do here. Let's keep moving."
"This door is well worn and the landing well used. It's got some unusual markings that I think are a code of some kind, though I can't read them. I wonder who calls this place their own."
"No doubt this is the house of some rich merchant. I bet there are guardians inside. Dangerous ones."
"Not a lot of cover here. This place doesn't suit my fighting style."
"Low light conditions. I sense danger!  Well. Nothing attacked out of the blue. But I still feel that danger is not far off."
"I don't fear the fey folk or their fungal circle. Let them do their worst."
"Normally I'm the quietest thing around, but this forest gives me the creeps. Feels something out there is already stalking us."
"Nergal I recognise. This is a shrine to the god of death. Can't say he's ever done anything for me, though I've sent him plenty of visitors."
"Well, we have slain, battled and sneaked our way to the ultimate prize - the Great Gate out of this Realm. No doubt the Third Realm will be even more dangerous."
"That stench... this was the lair of some kind of beast. Perhaps it will come back and find us here?"
"I guess that this sort of vista is why they call this part of the Realm the wastelands."
"Another bunch of suicidal idiots."
"Perhaps this is how it ends."
"Kill them all."
"Waste of my time."
"We're not dead. Yet."
"Somebody make sure they're all dead."
"This will impair my efficiency."
"This will improve my efficiency."
"So this is what it comes to. I have no regrets."
"Does this hurt?"
"Feel the pain."
"Fear me."
"I'll come. As long as there's a lot of killing."
"Death is patient. He will wait a little longer for me."
"I think something is hidden here. One of you lot have a look around."
"Stay down."

Personality: Mystic
Description: Reflective, solitary and meditative. Zen seeks and truth, and has limited 6th sense and ESP powers.
Example speech: 
"She has passed away."
"He has passed away."
"I am somewhat wounded."
"Let us depart, when the time is right."
"You can blind my eyes, but you can never blind my soul."
"My body may be afflicted with a disease."
"I will not fear. Fear is... uh...."
"Your attempts to dirsupt my equilibrium are futile."
"Aiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"
"Woooooooooooooooooooooo!"
"Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"
"I will remain focussed."
"I will remain focussed."
"My mind is not impaired."
"That attack was envenomed."
"I will pause for a moment of meditation."
"Pause a moment, friends. Listen to the city around us.  The rhythm of life goes on, even here deep under the ground."
"We are born of ashes and to ashes we return. I sense that one happened here, though I cannot say which."
"We are disrupting the balance of this place. We should go."
"*sigh*  Life. Mine... mine is a series of passing-through moments. Moving ever outwards, ever seeking, ever changing, never static.  Here is another. Who knows where this one leads, or if I will return this way? If I stayed here, would I be better or worse off?  Futile conjecture. Let me turn my face back towards the dim glow of this magical doorway. My path, as always, is set."
"So this is the Second Realm. Pause for a moment. Observe, the dungeon falls silent as the echos of our footfalls die away.  The uncertainty in our future is matched only by the conflict in our past, but ultimately such metaphors are artificial and should be discarded."
"I sense a disturbance in the hive."
"I foresee that thing awakening and assaulting us."
"A place veiled in shadows and dust. There's an energy here, both ancient and mysterious. Let us move with caution and respect for the spirits that dwell."
"I sense an enigma in its silence. Patience, my friends, the answers may reveal themselves in due time."
"The echoes of their last moments linger, a lesson written in silence."
"I sense darkness behind this door. Darkness and... eyes."
"Here stands the Grey Wayfarer?s altar, a beacon for the lost and the vigilant. In the silence, his wisdom whispers to those who listen."
"I sense a harmony with nature here that was not present in the town Ichiba. I do not sense any pressing danger."
"This unremarkable corridor fills me with a sense of impending madness and chaos."
"Few environs are more condusive to isolating the soul that a busy city."
"Darkness into light.   The earth is moist here, and the gentle sounds and motions of nature move around us. For a brief moment, we are the silent center of the forest."
"Silence surrounds us. No life to be heard, save the beat of my own heart. All else is dry and barren."
"I see... I see... fire and terror... the cries of the dying... the stench of burning buildings. Death and despair, darkness and hatred...  My visions are gone. The icy wind whips and whines through broken windows and over jagged timber frames. We are alone amidst the ruins."
"The silence presses all around, like a living thing. I sense hidden eyes... watching."
"Pause a moment, friends. The dungeon is silent - the fury of the demon guardian is a spent force behind us.  I sense no premonition of what lies behind the Great Gate, my sixth sense is quiet."
"I see... I am hunched in a squalid hut... a cold dead fire pit, filled with charred bones.... madness and rage... my knees ache... I reach out and choose a bone from the pit... gnawing... gnawing...  Ah. That was a powerful vision."
"I do not know why they seek conflict."
"I will not fear. Fear is the mind killer."
"I sense hostility."
"Their fear turned against them."
"The fortunes of battle have favoured us."
"This is a welcome return to silence."
"We have little need of these material possessions."
"True riches are not material."
"All who live enter this life alone. And, at the end, no one can take allies or possessions with them into the next."
"Why do you seek conflict?"
"Hayai!"
"Your anger is your undoing."
"Perhaps you will select me. I already know the outcome."
"My next life awaits, but the time is not yet come."
"Stop and search. We will find something."
"Farewell, foe. Seek greater balance in your next life."

Personality: Peer
Description: Diplomatic, chivalrous and thoughtful, the Peer is an aristocratic warrior.
Example speech: 
"She died with honour."
"He died with honour."
"'Tis merely a scratch."
"Let us sally forth without delay."
"Darkness surrounds me."
"I feel rather unwell."

"This itching will not distract me."
"I feel a little queasy."
"I am paralysed."
"That blade was poisoned!"
"Fie on this dishonourable entanglement!"
"To my eye this city looks large and well organised. Underground, it is obviously intended to be easily defensible. That small fort above ground looked well defended, and I believe that any invader that penetrated this far would be at a serious disadvantage to the locals."
"This appears to be a small symmetrical keep with six towers and a thick curtain wall. On the one hand the fortifications are impressive and there is no doubt that storming them would be a difficult task. On the other, there is no fallback position once attackers breach the walls.  I see several possibilties. The designers could be incompetent or over-confident. This construction could be for a purpose other than defence - for show perhaps, or for barracks. Or the structure could be intended to keep something in, rather than keep attackers out."
"At long last, our valour has seen us safely to the Second Realm. I had hoped for a warmer welcome, but this appears to be some sort of dungeon or cell. I am unaware of what to expect from this Realm, but have no doubt that my sword arm will be called upon. Probably quite soon."
"Ah, the insect world seeks to test our mettle. Fear not, my friends, for we shall endure this pestilent onslaught with the poise befitting our noble stature."
"Observe the artistry of this statue, friends. A craftsmanship not of this Realm, I dare say."
"This gloomy ambiance, the dust and cobwebs - it's as if the dungeon itself mourns. Stay close, friends, and let us face whatever challenges lie ahead with dignity."
"An intriguing development. Let us approach it with caution and reason. We may uncover the key to its activation without unnecessary risks."
"Rest well, unknown warrior. If you leave behind wisdom, we shall heed it."
"Beyond this closed portal, a foreboding presence lingers. My friends, ready your weapons, for darkness lies in wait."
"The Grey Wayfarer's mark upon this shrine: a reminder that even the most valiant must be wary, for the road conceals both danger and opportunity."
"I see a primitive village, tanning hides and hunting for food. These type of peoples are usually proud and sensitive, our best path to avoiding a fight will be to stay within local cultural norms."
"Behind this unremarkable facade, no doubt danger lurks around every corner."
"This hamlet, run down though it seems, is probably the best chance for finding our feet in the Second Realm, and learning what awaits us along our chosen road."
"The fresh air on my face is a pleasant change. Given the nearby pathway, I think it's reasonable to assume that there will be a settlement of some sort nearby."
"This expanse of waste seems to have precious little to offer us. Best be on our way as fast as possible."
"This has all the signs of a settlement that has been sacked. Walls and doors have been broken and torn down. Many buildings are blackened with fire. In a few places I see what must be the remains of slain defenders. All is covered with a layer of dust and mould. Whatever violence happened here, it was a long time ago."
"This stifling forest reeks of evil - my skin crawls. Keep your your weapons near, friends."
"By the strength of our sword arms we have prevailed and won through. And yet, we have no choice but to go forward into even greater peril."
"Bah, gnats getting in my armour! Alas, these hardships must be endured."
"This should pose no significant problem."
"With courage and valour we will prevail. Let every man do his duty."
"Ready your arms for battle, a foe approaches."
"We will face sterner tests yet."
"By our virtue and discipline we have won great honour and glory."
"Victory is our due."
"It is a heavy burden, but I will bear it."
"Treasure fit for a king!"
"I may have failed to protect them, but you will not take me alive. Come and face my blade."
"Stechen!"
"Oberhau!"
"Abschneiden!"
"I would be honoured to serve with you."
"I have been brought back to continue my service. Thank you comrades."
"I believe I see something hidden!"
"You are slain."

Personality: Pro
Description: Simple and straightforward, an expert on dungeoneering.
Example speech: 
"Man down, man down!"
"Man down, man down!"
"Healer!"
"Let's move out."
"Has anyone else been blinded too?"
"Ugh, a nasty disease."
"Yikes!"
"Some kind of curse?"
"Heh."
"Ha ha ha."
"Wa ha ha ha!"
"Damn itchy, this."
"Don't worry, I've got a cast iron stomach."
"Paralysed! I'll talk you guys through it, just do as I say."
"Anyone got an anti-venom?"
"I'm stuck in this stuff!"
"Looks pretty quiet. Gnomes everywhere.  There must be a tavern somewhere. I've heard that gnomes distill a good liqour."
"Just another inexplicable dungeon thingy. Let's move on."
"Hmmm. Smells like... plants. Lots of plants. And danger. Lots too. And something else..."
"Quite the castle. Be tough to get in here if they didn't want you. But if you did, it would be mighty tough for them to get out..."
"A big portal right under their castle? No wonder the knights are nervous."
"So this is the Second Realm. Not surprised it's a dungeon complex.  Hmmm. This dungeon smells like dust and vermin. Probably some sort of guardian beasts too. Wonder which direction the first attack will come from..."
"Looks like the local bug population isn't too thrilled about our presence."
"No doubt this is the part where the statue comes to life."
"Dusty corridors, cobwebs... classic signs of neglect. Dungeon maintenance is clearly not a priority here. Stay alert, though. These conditions can conceal danger."
"Hmm. Looks like a classic transdimensional gateway. Not powered right now. Maybe we can figure out its activation mechanism."
"Bones tell stories. This one says: 'I wasnâ??t ready.'"
"I smell spiders."
"Hail Garret, friend of those who walk dangerous paths."
"Bunch of armed gnolls here. Might be enough to take us down by weight of numbers."
"Good firm floor, solid walls. Plenty of choke points, not a lot of muck or cover. Not a bad looking dungeon.  Hmmm... I smell damp, varnish, and a hint of sorcery. More than a hint. There's a lot of magic here."
"That's a Wing Chun kata of the Inner Circle!   I have trained with students from this style, but never a graduate of the Inner School. And never one that has giant razor sharp blades instead of fists."
"Looks like a town where there's lots of fights. Suits me fine, as long as there's also lots of good food."
"Jungles aren't my favourite place. Usually lots of hungry toothy poisonous things. Best to keep moving."
"The good thing about deserts is that it's hard to be taken by surprise."
"Danger. That's the one thing I expect here. Loot too, maybe. But mostly danger."
"Hmmm. I smell mould and death. And silence."
"Through the Portal to the Third Realm is our way forward. Glory lies behind, and greater glory awaits!"
"Hmmm. Smells like dragon in here. Kinda faded and faint though..."
"Swamps are always dangerous. Things with poisons and things with strange diseases.  Something about this swamp makes my nervous, but I'm not sure what because it looks pretty normal from here."
"Fresh meat for the grinder."
"Don't panic, I've seen worse."
"I'll take the point."
"No problem."
"Everyone ok?"
"Let's keep moving."
"Unf. Do I look like a pack mule?"
"Nice piece!"
"Yeah, but I'm still here. Come and get some, scum!"
"Attack!"
"Hya!"
"Yes!"
"Dungeons, foes and loot? I'm there."
"Thanks, death is overrated. Do we still have enough resurrection powders?"
"Something hidden here! Watch my back while I have a look..."
"One down."

Personality: Sage
Description: Whimsical, wise old sage. Full of cryptic riddles, wise sayings, and koans.
Example speech: 
"A beautiful woman who is pleasing to men is good only for frightening fish when she falls into the water."
"The best leaders of all, the people know not they exist. They turn to each other and say 'We did it ourselves'."
"To know and not to do is not yet to know."
"The journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step."
"Even a blind hog finds an acorn every now and then."
"There are some remedies worse than the disease."
"Worry is an addiction that interferes with compassion."
"We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want."
"You in should have your practice because be grateful you for the rather enrich mind they will eventually weeds your."
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"
"Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!"
"Water and words... Easy to pour, impossible to recover."
"Some people walk in the rain, others just get wet."
"Sitting quietly, doing nothing, spring comes, and the grass grows by itself."
"Better to struggle with a sick donkey than carry the wood by yourself."
"The greatest patience is humility."
"Show me a city, my old master used to say, and I will show you the best and worst of Man."
"A wise man once said: one day, even the grass and trees will become enlightened  Yet of what use is it to discuss how grass and trees become enlightened? The question is how you yourself can become so."
"They say that a broken mirror never reflects again; fallen flowers never go back to the old branches."
"Better a dark deserted dungeon than a bright one teeming with hostile foes. This apears to be the former rather than the latter."
"In their swarm, lessons are written in buzzing wings."
"Behold, a statue veiled in the shadows of the past. Stone sentinel of forgotten tales. Let us ponder its stony whispers and unveil the secrets it guards."
"The dance of dust and cobwebs, a symphony of neglect. In darkness, wisdom can be found. Keep your senses keen, my friends, for the path ahead may be cryptic."
"A portal, my companions, is but a door to the unknown without. To unlock its secrets, one must first embrace the mysteries within."
"Even the boldest of paths end in dust."
"Vigilance is our lantern; let its light guide us through the veil of uncertainty."
"In shadows the wayfarer finds protection and the wanderer discovers the strength to face the unknown."
"My spirit sees into the other world. Bones and strange fungi litter the floor and protrude from the walls. Roofless passages open into a swirling sky of chaos and clouds, from which massive skeletal hands emerge, descending from the sky and feeling blindly over the corridors below. Grotesque phantasms fly above and through the walls, silent screams distorting their almost-human faces. I have never before experienced a spirit world this different to the physical reality."
"As usual with densly inhabited places, I see a striking withdrawal of the spirit world here. This place is firmly rooted in reality, rooted by mud and smoke and sweat, and the only dreams that we are likely to have here are dark ones."
"Oft behind the prettiest visage do the deadliest snares lie."
"He who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened."
"We shall have no shortage of salt for the evening meal."
"A great curse lies over this place. My spirit sight can see the souls of the slain lamenting their fate. I... am lost for words."
"My mentor used to say: always strive to be the quietest hunter in the forest. It sounds to me like this particular forest is full of hunters trying to be very quiet.  The spirit world is close here... a dark part of the spirit world. I see the shadows between trees begin to take on strange shapes, until I turn your head and focus on them with my mortal eyes."
"Walk silently and carry a big stick, my old master used to say.  This we have done, and here we are. Little would even he have imagined his favourite pupil making it this far. More danger awaits, but I feel prepared for it."
"Well, at least we won't be short of water here."
"The obstacle is the path."
"One day a student asked Taiga: 'What is the most difficult part of painting?' Taiga answered: 'The part of the paper where nothing is painted is the most difficult.'"
"Who can wait quietly until the mud settles? Who can remain still until the moment of action?"
"Before enlightenment; chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment; chop wood, carry water."
"It takes a wise man to learn from his mistakes, but an even wiser man to learn from others."
"The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences."
"Burdened by the memories of the past, burdened by the projections of the future, I go on living."
"The sage does not collect precious things. He does not hold on to ideas. He brings men back to what they have lost."
"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's mind there are few."
"Two hands clap and there is a sound. What is the sound of one hand?"
"Only when you can be extremely pliable and soft can you be extremely hard and strong."
"The tighter you squeeze, the less you have."
"He who chases two rabbits will lose them both."
"The infinite is in the finite of every instant."
"Is a lamp brought in to be hidden under a basket?"
"When the pupil is ready to learn, a teacher will appear."

Personality: Scholar
Description: Business-like, educated, scientific..
Example speech: 
"Oh no, I'll miss her!"
"I will write a moving obituary for him."
"Are any of you qualified to give emergency trauma care?"
"No, wait! I need to go back and get my books!"
"Nothing shocks me. I'm a scientist."
"I'm seeing some worrying symptoms."
"Oh dear!"
"I appear to be the target of some kind of interesting curse or hex."
"Tee hee hee hee hee hee!"
"He he he he he he he he he!"
"Ha ha ha ha ha, ah ha ha ha!"
"Some kind of irritant... fascinating. I'm breaking out in a distinct rash."
"Ugh. I feel sick!"
"An intriguing effect. I am immobilised but otherwise fully aware."
"That's certainly some kind of venom. I will let you know as the symptoms progress."
"Adhesive tendrils. Fascinating. I appear to be stuck fast."
"A fascinating place. The workmanship of these passages suggests to me the use of some kind of machines... and look at these glowing globes on the ceilings - they seem to be mechanical rather than magical! There is perhaps more to these gnomes than meets the eye."
"I note that these reflective panels have been rotated to face the sun. Odd."
"I've never seen trees this big! Amazing. An where is the animal life? I can't hear so much as a cricket..."
"Danaos Castle! It shows up my sources of research, back there in the First Realm, that I did not read of this place."
"One of the manuscripts that I deciphered referred to this "the Gatehouse", and described it as a small dungeon complex with several one-way Gates out to various locations in the Second Realm.  I do not expect to encounter particularly fearsome foes here, but my knowledge of this Realm is perforce quite sparse and it would be best to be prepared for conflict."
"Insects! Remarkable creatures, really. Did you know they communicate primarily through pheromones? Unfortunately, these seem quite hostile."
"I have read that these things sometimes come to life..."
"Cobwebs, moldy smell... fascinating! I should collect some samples for my studies. Proceed with caution, comrades, and let's learn from the dungeon's secrets."
"Fascinating! A portal of arcane origins, inoperable. I wish I could consult my tomes! The answer may lie in ancient knowledge."
"These bones are quite old, but I'm fairly certain that they are the remains of an adult human or human-like male not yet out of middle age."
"Perhaps a cautious approach is in order."
"The Grey Wayfarer is known for his dual nature - both protector and adversary. Observe the symbols closely; they may offer insights into his guidance for wayfarers like us."
"I recall nothing of gnolls from my research into the Second Realm.  I'm no an expert cultural anthropologist, but this small village seems to me to be a late iron age affair, populated by a primitive warrior people. They will be prone to pride and superstition and short of temper."
"This place looks unremarkable, but it emanates strong chaotic magic. All is not as it seems, but I cannot pierce the illusion. Best be prepared for the unexpected."
"I detect some small magick at work here."
"This door radiates strong magic."
"Ichiba... I did read of a town near the entrance to the Second Realm, but the name does not ring a bell. It says much about the accuracy of my sources. In any case, most of my information beyond this point is mere scraps; we're going to have to survive mostly on our wits from now."
"This is a broad leaved deciduous forest in a subtropical climate.  My information on conditions following the Gatehouse is sparse, and there was no mention of a jungle. But there should be an inhabited settlement nearby. As indeed the presence of that pathway suggests."
"A bright red sky. How intriguing. I wonder how it gets it's colour?  Alas, we cannot remain here to investigate. In any case, my instruments of astronomical observation were left back in the First Realm."
"This town has been thoroughly dismantled. Many of the fallen walls and smashed buildings seem to be the result of the sacking, not old age. Perhaps some kind of siege engine was employed? Yet, all is covered with dirt and dust. This devastation clearly occurred some time ago."
"Magic swirls strongly in this dark forest. Something supernatural is at work."
"The portal radiates very strong magick. This is undoubtably one of the Great Gates. Friends, we have discovered the road to the Third Realm.  I know little of what awaits us save what we have learned in this Realm. The only way to find out is to pass through the Gate."
"I detect an odd aura of sorcery about this marsh, but nothing that I can quit pin down."
"We should be more than a match for these opponents."
"Maybe we should try and talk about this first?"
"Their intentions seem to be hostile."
"They clearly had a faulty understanding of statistics."
"*Gulp* I don't like the odds here!"
"Let me examine the bodies for clues..."
"I doubt that this loot is worth the weight."
"This should be in a museum!"
"I should have stayed in my library!"
"The pen is mightier than the sword."
"Let's be reasonable here..."
"Perhaps we should have negotiated first?"
"I've done extensive research into the Maze. Can I bring my books along?"
"Goodness, I'll have to write a book about that!"
"I do believe I detect something hidden nearby."
"I got one!"

Personality: Sensitive
Description: Feminine, squeamish, girly. Sees fey folk and sprites.
Example speech: 
"No! I can't believe she's dead! She was like a sister to me! Somebody do something!"
"Oh no! He's dead! Oh dear, I'll miss him so much. What are we going to do?"
"Ouch! Oh dear, I'm bleeding an awful lot here!"
"Starting a journey is always so exciting! What a pity I can't bring any of my little faeries with us."
"Hey, I can't see any more!"
"I think I'm getting sick."
"Oh dear!"
"Oh dear, what is wrong with me?"
"Heee hee hee hee hee hee hee!"
"Ooooo! Hee hee hee hee! Ha ha ha ha ha!"
"Weeeeeeeee! Hee hee hee hee!"
"Hey, that tickles!"
"Eiuw, that's disgusting!"
"Hey, I can't move! Don't you guys go trying to tickle me now..."
"Ooo. I don't feel so good."
"Hey, I'm stuck in the stuff!"
"A gnome city? It looks rather gloomy and stuffy to me. I suppose at least it's clean and warm."
"Someone built a big fire here! I see no wee folk nearby, they are avoiding this place."
"This thing doesn't make a great mirror."
"Um, guys? I kinda feel like we're not supposed to be here. Not that I mind or anything, but... hey, maybe we should just leave? Like, now? Before something bad happens to us..."
"Well, this is a depressing dungeon. Our luck has held and we've made it to the Second Realm. But your journey to escape the Maze has only just begun. The sooner we get out of this dingy tomb and into the wider Realm the better."
"Eek! Insects! I hate bugs! Someone do something about these creepy crawlies, please!"
"Oh, what an ugly statue!"
"Eek! Cobwebs! I can't stand this dusty, creepy place. Why couldn't we explore a nice garden instead? Watch out for spiders, everyone!"
"Oh, my! Do you think there are fairies on the other side?"
"Oh my, thatâ??s so sad. I suppose not everyone makes it out of places like this."
"I sense something really spooky on the other side. Maybe we should, you know, reconsider?"
"Oh, this shrine is so mysterious and, um, a little spooky."
"What a charming little village! But I've never really been a dog person. And savages are always too over-the-top-macho for me.  Hey look! Sweet little faeries and sprites, gambolling here and there! These gnolls seem close to nature, whatever else their faults."
"It looks empty and boring, but I can't see any faeries! I'm not sure what that means. This place makes me very nervous."
"What a pretty garden! Looks at the little sprites playing everywhere! Magical!"
"This door radiates strong magic."
"What a dirty, stinky city. Devoid of faerie folk, as far as I can see.   Still, a hot meal, a nice bath and a clean bed would go a long way right now."
"Hey, what a cheerful forest. Life and growth everywhere!  Look! Tiny little leaf sprites, darting through that tree! The first fey that I've seen in the Second Realm."
"Yuck, dust everywhere! Especially in my mouth. They faerie folk have deserted this Domain, and I think that we should do the same!"
"How depressingly cold and dark. Don't think we'll find a welcome here, the people have either fled or died.  I see a few types of feylings. Slinking and hiding around the broken buildings - malicious sprites, all of them. This is a dark place."
"What a big faerie mushroom circle grows in this glade. Gosh, but what an evil one! An old, dark circle, steeped in centuries of fey hatred and blood.  They're watching us, you know. The wee fey folk, they watch us from the trees as we approach their circle, suddenly taking note... Don't look straight at them!"
"How gloomy! I see faeries - dark, evil forest spritelings, things of fangs and claws hunting eachother.  Ugh - they're not the nice sort of faerie folk."
"We have won through to the Great Gate!  I always dreamed that I was destined to escape from the Maze. Maybe, just maybe, that dream may come true one day..."
"Look, tiny fey sprites frolicking through the foliage! They always seem to enjoy this type of terrain.   Doesn't seem too dangerous here, just the usual beasties. I'm going to get all dirty in that muck though."
"Don't be silly, we'll win this one easily."
"Oh my! I think we're in trouble!"
"Let's all work together now."
"Told you we'd win this one easy!"
"I can't believe it. We're alive!"
"Hooray for us!"
"Oh my, I don't know if I can carry all this stuff very far."
"Ooo, wow, this is something special! Does it come in red?"
"Oh dear, this isn't good. Guys? I hope some of you are playing dead..."
"Hey! Take this!"
"Hayai, take that!"
"Yeee ha!"
"How exciting! I'd love to come with you!"
"Oh my. Thanks for bringing me back."
"What's that hidden over there?"
"Oops, you're dead!"

Personality: Team Player
Description: The Team Player is always there, always positive, always on your side.
Example speech: 
"She was an important part of the team."
"We'll miss his contribution."
"I need patching up here!"
"I'm on your side!"
"This isn't what I meant by 'go blind side'."
"I think I'll be out for a few weeks with this."
"Aaaaaaarrrrrrrrggggggggghhhhhhhh!!!"
"That's really not cricket!"
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah!"
"Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!"
"Heh hee hee hee hee hee hee!"
"I must have picked up an itch in the showers..."
"Ugh, feels like when I fluffed the championship play."
"I'm offside here! Keep going without me!"
"Poison? How unsporting!"
"I'm bogged down in this stuff."
"Team, look around! We've hit the jackpot - Aenen, the hidden gnome city! Time to spread the good vibes and make some pint-sized allies."
"Touchdown in the secret forest Domain! Green magic is the MVP."
"Now, that's what I call a home fortress."
"This weather is perfect for a spot of cricket. Shall I measure out 22 yards?"
"Team, we've scored our ticket to the Second Realm! Victory is sweet, and the challenges ahead are our new playing field."
"Keep calm, stay close, and let's swarm them back!"
"Looks like the local art is not just for show? That statue is making a move!"
"No worries, team! We can handle anything together. Stay close, and let's light up this gloomy corner with our camaraderie!"
"A Gate, team! Let's work together to figure it out."
"They played the game and lost. Letâ??s make sure we win."
"Team, senses tingling. Ready for the showdown?"
"Garret is one that I'd rather have on my team than otherwise."
"These gnolls might look laid back, but I've got a feeling they could bring some serious game if they needed to."
"Our teamwork is our secret weapon against the traps and spectral surprises."
"Stay sharp team, and keep your eyes open for opportunities. With teamwork we'll conquer this city's challenges and leave our mark in every corner!"
"Mmm, breathe in that fresh air! Ready for some outdoor victories, team? Let's get out A-game on!"
"It's like nature's own game of chess, and we're the players.  The heat's intense, but our team spirit burns brighter. Ready for a strategic move, everyone?  ... everyone?"
"Let's stick together, navigate carefully, and honor the fallen. Our teamwork will light up this twilight and drive out the shadows."
"Let's weave through these twisted trees like the champions we are. I'll take the point!"
"No room for confusion here team. Let's turn this challenge into a triumph with our teamwork."
"This should be a walk in the park."
"We'd better up our game here!"
"Stay focused team!"
"Piece of cake."
"An epic victory!"
"Good job team."
"This kit is slowing me down here."
"Wow, this is great! Thanks!"
"Guys? Guys? Oh no..."
"Take this!"
"My turn!"
"Hup!"
"Pick me captain, I've improved!"
"Way to go, I'm back in the team!"
"Something is hidden nearby! Let's split up and search the area!"
"Gotcha!"

Personality: The Silent Type
Description: Never says anything.
Example speech: 

Personality: Valiant
Description: Brash, bold, valourous and adventurous. With a sensative side.
Example speech: 
"I will avenge you my sister."
"He was a valiant ally. I will miss him."
"I will fight through the pain. See to the other wounded first."
"Onward to victory!"
"It's all gone dark here."
"This isn't slowing me down much, yet."
"Yaaaaaaaaaaa!"
"I'm fine, just a passing cloud."
"Ya ha ha ha ha ha ha hah!"
"Har har har har har har!"
"Huh huh huh huh huh huh!"
"Is that supposed to slow me down?"
"Ugh, feeling green. Will keep going."
"Hnnnnnnn! Can't move a muscle!"
"Ugh, poison!"
"I'm stuck fast!"
"The hidden city of the gnomes! It looks clean and well ordered. And well defended - I note that most of the population is armed.  Still, I welcome this small piece of civilisation amidst the wilds of the Maze. Let us not anger the inhabitants while we are here."
"Finally, we have won through to the Second Realm, a feat that already sets us amongst the greatest of my childhood heroes.  To my eyes this dreary dungeon looks much like any other. No doubt there will be fresh tests of our valour near at hand..."
"Angry insects assail us? Ha! Let them taste the sting of our courage. Onward, through the swarm!"
"A stoic figure, frozen in time. I wonder what tales this statue could tell had it but a voice."
"Dust and cobwebs won't stop us. Onward, my friends! Glory awaits on the other side of these shadows."
"A portal! By the gods, I'm itching for an adventure. Let's find a way to light this magical beacon."
"Here lies another who dared the darkness and paid the price."
"Feel that chill? Beyond this door, a dance with dark adversaries awaits. Ready your weapons, comrades!"
"Let us honor the guardian of heroes and travelers with our respect."
"Most of these gnolls are armed with spears and daggers, and look like they can use them.  The village seems peaceful enough, but I suspect it would be best to avoid offending the locals."
"I am not fooled by this plain passage. No doubt this is some sort of horrid dungeon, teeming with evil beasts."
"A dingy frontier boom town. Best to be on our guard. It'll be packed full of thieves, drunkards and conmen. We may have to bash in a few heads before getting any respect."
"Fresh air! I've always loved the outdoors. This forest is a welcome relief, even though I'm sure it's packed full of ferocious animals.  We should probably press on until we find some sort of settlement."
"I find it hard to imagine a more inhospitable landscape. Surviving here will be a true test of our valour."
"The air carries a chill here. Something about this deserted city fills me with fear. Loosten your weapons in their sheaths, comrades."
"I like forests, but this place strikes a bad chord. I expect trouble - the sort of trouble that will need to die at the end of my blade."
"As I always expected, our valour has won us through! We have won out against all that the Maze could throw at us."
"Ugh, a stinking bog. As like as not there's little glory to be had here. Just killing disgusting swamp creatures and getting filthy in the process."
"Let's charge and scatter them!"
"Gather your courage. Our names will be remembered in legend!"
"To arms!"
"They were no match for us."
"By the strength of our arms we have won an great victory today!"
"We have triumphed yet again."
"I will try my best to carry this load."
"A valuable bauble. I am in your debt."
"I will return with my shield, or on it."
"Ha!"
"Feel my steel!"
"Scum!"
"Our foes will fall before me."
"Many thanks for bringing me back. I am not ready for the afterlife!"
"This area seems worth searching."
"To victory!"

Personality: Veteran
Description: Deadpan, world weary, diplomatic. He leans on his sword amidst heaps of the slain.
Example speech: 
"Rest her soul."
"Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him well."
"This is more than just a scratch."
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
"Blindness doesn't help."
"The plague. Not good."
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRGGHHH!"
"Another dark curse. They usually pass."
"He he he he he he he he he heh."
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"Har har har! Har har har! Har har har!"
"Godammit, that is irritating."
"*urk*"
"Perhaps you'll be able to hit me now."
"Poison? Really!?"
"Stuck!"
"An unconventional fortress, but by the looks of it quite an effective one. One wonders what works the little people busy themselves with, here under the ground."
"Feels like I'm being watched. I don't like this place."
"I'm sure these guys are quite brave here, behind these walls."
"So we have reached the Second Realm.  This dungeon is not really what I expected from the Realm, but then fate is eternally capricious. Come what may, we should have little trouble making a name in this new land."
"I've faced worse pests than these."
"Surely not an animated statue?"
"A darker part of the dungeon. Keep your senses sharp. Likely spiders lurking."
"Another portal, huh? Seen plenty in my time. Best be careful, though. They don't always lead to happy places. Keep your wits about you."
"Take whatâ??s useful. Leave the rest to dust."
"Behind this door lies more than just shadows."
"The Grey Wayfarer?s mark. We?re on sacred ground."
"Let us examine this primitive village.  I see many warriors, all with weapons near at hand, ready to mobilise at a moment's notice. This settlement is ready for battle, fitting for an outpost in the Maze."
"Passages and doors... something about this maze rings a bell for me, but I can't quite place it...   Surely an unremarkable place like this shouldn't bring forth any memories? I feel uneasy, but can't quite put a finger on why."
"I've seen this kind of frontier town before. There will be haggling and barter. There will be mud and smoke. There will be violence, most probably ending with some desperate vagabond dying on the point of my sword.   It reminds me of home... but we can never go back."
"This forest sooths my spirit. But no doubt it harbours dangerous foes. There's probably some kind of habitation at the end of that path."
"Remind me of an artists impression of hell I once saw."
"So, this is what happens when the Maze pushes back, when it decides that peace and prosperity have grown too far and need to be nipped in the bud. This town has been thoroughly sacked and it's inhabitants put to the sword then left to lie where they fell.  I hope that we can avoid this same fate."
"Hmmm, the unmistakable scent of danger. Methinks that we have left civilised lands behind us."
"A moment while I clean my blade, comrades.  It was a hard journey, but our strength and honour have won us the way to the Third Realm. No doubt more danger awaits there, but I for one will meet it as I always do, with the point of a sword."
"It seems that this road no longer leads where it used to. Instead, we are no doubt heading into danger, once again. Onwards, then."
"They must be crazy. Let's not waste much time on this."
"Cry 'havoc' and let slip the dogs of war!"
"The game's afoot."
"Another battle, another victory."
"That was quite a fight."
"Give me a moment while I clean my blade."
"We're carrying too much junk here."
"This'll look nice on my mantelpiece."
"Live by the sword, die by the sword. Come and get me."
"Ha!"
"Hya!"
"Hmpf!"
"Looks like quite an journey you have planned."
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
"Let us pause a bit and investigate here."
"Another great treasure."

Personality: Wayfarer
Description: An outdoorsman. Observant, thoughtful and free spirited. Prefers outdoors.
Example speech: 
"My wounds are slowing me down..."
"The open road lies before us."
"I will operate by scent and hearing."
"A noxious plague has afflicted me."
"Got a bad feeling about this."
"This is some kind of curse."
"Er heh heh heh heh heh he he he."
"Heh he he heh heh!"
"Ha ha ha ha! Heh!"
"It's an irritant of some kind..."
"Ugh, surely not my claustrophobia?"
"Some kind of paralysis afflicts me."
"I am afflicted with some kind of venom."
"These strands are hampering my progress."
"This underground catacomb makes me uneasy. Hopefully we can finish our business here quickly and depart with due haste."
"This was not a natural fire, nor do I believe it was a lightning strike. Also I would suggest that the tree was felled before the blaze was lit."
"Wel now, this is something I haven't seen before..."
"Wait! There's something unusual about this forest... No animal life! I can't hear anything... and yet, I feel an amazing wellspring of natural magic permeating everything here...  Wow. I'm amazed and privileged to visit a place like this. An yet... I have an uneasy feeling that we don't really belong here. We need to be very, very careful..."
"I didn't expect the entrance to the Second Realm to be a dungeon.  The air here is stuffy and unhealthy, and I feel uneasy about the weight of stone above our heads. The dusty floor of this room shows no tracks of any sort, but I do see what appears to be bat droppings."
"Brace yourselves, folk, we've got a buzzing storm on our hands!"
"Take care, in some realms these things are set as guardians to attack intruders."
"Reminds me of the spider caves back in the foothills of the First Realm. Let's tread carefully, mates."
"This curious portal will take us nowhere today. Nature's mysteries often hold the key. Let's observe, appreciate, and perhaps find the way through."
"Looks like these bones have been here for quite a long time."
"Hold on folk. The air behind this door reeks of shadows and whispers. Best be prepared before cracking this one open."
"Garret?s shrine! A beacon for those who wander."
"Gnolls are known for their cunning woodcraft. I saw no tracks approaching the village. Smoke from the huts dissipates low overhead. Despite their casual attitude, they're keeping noise to a minimum and are all well armed.   This village is no soft hamlet - I am impressed."
"I always hate not being able to see the sky.  For what it's worth, this corridor has a thin layer of dust that is devoid of tracks. Nobody has been down here for a while."
"These plants have been left to grow as they will, but I see signs that someone has been tending this patch of greenery."
"The dust on everything here suggests a room that is not often used."
"This town stinks. Mostly of people and smoke, but also of animals, excrement, mud, dust, and something unnatural that I can't quite put my finger on.  Let us not tarry here too long."
"Mmmm, fresh air! Just smell the complex scents of this forest!  I do not recognise any specific plant life, but there's nothing unusual given the climate. Forests like these are always teeming with life - reptiles, insects and birds in particular."
"Hush.  Here that? Nothing. The usual forest sounds have died away. There is probably some kind of large predator is probably nearby."
"I'd say this is probably a shrine devoted to Garret, the trickster god of heroes, adventurers and travellers. I have enough tales of him to keep a tavern rapt for several nights in a row."
"Nasty looking place. This blood red sky is quite unusual, but on the ground this Domain appears to be a dry salt pan, completely normal, barring those odd pillars."
"Hmmm. Much of what I smell here is unnatural. Even the wind, blowing from the south east, bears the reek of something foul. Some faintly reptilian tracks are visible in this courtyard, but I do not recognise them."
"Extreme, unsettling silence here, different to the usual woodland hush when a major predator is around. Something supernatural is at work here.   See these dark twisted trees, the fungus covering the forest floor? The heavy canopy far overhead through which just a little greenish light filters... this forest is a place of evil, of that I have no doubt."
"I can scarce believe that we have won through this far. I hope that the Great Gate leads somewhere more pleasant than this gloomy dungeon."
"Well, the marsh seems to have swallowed whatever road lies ahead.  This vegetation and apparent wildlife seem typical of the climate. We're going to have to be wary of poisons and diseases. Also, terrain like this is very hard to move through without leaving a trail."
"Let's finish this quickly."
"This presents a challenge. We should have tried to evade them."
"Foes."
"Let's not tarry here."
"We should try and avoid scraps like that in future."
"Let us conceal the bodies and continue."
"I'm overloaded here."
"In all my travels I have seen few such treasures as this."
"I usually work best alone."
"Hah!"
"Drawing a bead..."
"Huzzah!"
"Together we will roam the wastelands and dare the perils of the Maze."
"Mmmmm, fresh air..."
"Somebody has hidden something here."
"A kill!"

Personality: Wit
Description: Laconic, sardonic and witty. Pragmatic and eloquent. The wit is never at a loss for words.
Example speech: 
"She always said she'd be the first of us to go."
"Looks like he's not getting up from that one."
"Perhaps it's the light, but this looks like an awful lot of my own blood."
"I'm ready to go."
"I'm struggling to see the funny side of this. Stuggling to see anything at all, for that matter."
"I don't think I'll be able to sleep this one off."
"Nooooooooo!"
"That bad feeling probably isn't a coincidence."
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!"
"Waaaaaaaaaaa haaaa haaaa haaa haaaa haa!  Haaa haa ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"Heeeeeeeeee! Hee hee hee hee!  Hah ha ha ha ha ha!"
"Hold that thought, I've got an itch to scratch."
"This churning in my belly isn't yesterday's dinner."
"I guess I'll just make them laugh themselves to death."
"My debilitating reaction to this small scratch leads me to suspect poison."
"Not the type of intimate embrace that I prefer."
"Ah, the gnomes, the little people! Small in stature but large in legend! Tirelessly delving deep beneath the earth, cunning hands working clever devices and subtle magicks. Vaulted halls echoing with the clash of hammers on red hot forges and the clink of priceless gems being carefully counted...  Ahem. Uh, right folks, let's go see whatever there is to see here."
"Charming spot for a barbecue."
"Hardly a vista that will fills anyone with terror, unless they're allergic to grass."
"So this is the fabled Second Realm. I've heard that there are cities to be found in the Realm, but this dank and echoing donjon clearly isn't one of them."
"It's not a dungeon crawl until you're knee-deep in angry bugs."
"Any bets on whether this statue will come to life?"
"Dust, cobwebs... a bit cliche, don't you think? I hope the monsters here have a better sense of style."
"Anyone got a witty remark for the occasion? No? Fine, I'll handle it. Let's hope the punchline isn't a monster."
"Looks like this one didn't make it."
"Behind this door lies... who knows what, but it's probably it's not a surprise birthday party."
"I suppose even shadows need their own corner of reverence."
"An idyllic village, harbouring a race of noble savages. See them loll and laze in the cheery sunshine, pride and cunning in every doglike face. Methinks that this savage folk could be ready for battle at a moment's notice."
"This place looks for all the world like my grandmother's cellar. Something of an anti-climax."
"Hardly a white walled city from a chivalric ballad, this. Hardly a properous city-state either.  Still, I find the prospect of some fresh company appealing."
"Well, if all the legendary terrors of the Second Realm are as idyllic as this then our time here might not be entirely unpleasant."
"The words of an old sonnet come to mind. Something about how, boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far away...."
"What an outstandingly dreary vista. Freezing cold, too, as if this land has not seen the kiss of sunlight for many a year."
"This is rather dark and gloomy. Hold on, I'll whistle us up a cheerful shanty!  ...  On second thoughts, maybe not."
"Seldom have the exploits of the heroes that I have sung about matched those of our own.   We have earned our place in the pantheon of legends, but I wonder if any will ever hear of our exploits?"
"This is a most dreary fen, but my boots have slogged through worse."
"Is there time for a quick nap?"
"If we get out of this one it'll make an excellent epic poem."
"Make sure you're holding the right end of the sword this time."
"I barely worked up a sweat."
"Let's try and avoid situations like that in future, OK?"
"Score one for the good guys."
"Surely you don't expect me to drag this stuff around?"
"This will look good on my mantelpiece."
"I clearly should have read that fine print."
"En guard."
"Try this for size..."
"Behind you!"
"No doubt you'd prefer if I didn't read the fine print on this contract."
"Lucky for you, I'd say that the other side ain't all it's cracked up to be."
"Something is hidden nearby! Let's search..."
"Looks like I win this round."

I do not recognise any specific plant life, but there's nothing unusual given the climate. Forests like these are always teeming with life - reptiles, insects and birds in particular.</td></tr>

Here that? Nothing. The usual forest sounds have died away. There is probably some kind of large predator is probably nearby.</td></tr>

See these dark twisted trees, the fungus covering the forest floor? The heavy canopy far overhead through which just a little greenish light filters... this forest is a place of evil, of that I have no doubt.</td></tr>
